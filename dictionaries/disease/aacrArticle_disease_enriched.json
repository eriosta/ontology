    "abstract": "Background:Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally, with NSCLC comprising around 85% and SCLC about 15%. Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been approved for NSCLC. However, TKIs favor the emergence of resistant cells, ultimately resulting in tumor relapse. EGFR and cMET are co-expressed oncoproteins, with cMET playing a pivotal role in resistance to EGFR TKI in NSCLC. SCLC commonly develops disease relapse and resistance following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, leading to a poor 5-year overall survival of below 7%. DLL3, an inhibitory Notch ligand, is selectively expressed on the surface of SCLC cells and represents a validated therapeutic target.Methods:Traditional ADC discovery relies on rational design, which often limits diversity and may exclude promising candidates due to the complexity of ADCs. Existing conjugation technologies are not well-suited for diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS), as they involve multi-step processes, low versatility, and inconsistent quality. Our proprietary enzymatic site-specific conjugation platforms, iGDC\u2122 and iLDC\u2122, enable high-throughput synthesis of diverse ADC libraries. Using the platforms, we created a broad ADC library targeting EGFR x cMET and DLL3, combining antibodies with various formats, different linkers, and payloads like MMAE, Eribulin, Exatecan, Lurbinectedin, and TopoIx. The resulting ADCs were rigorously evaluated using in vitro cytotoxicity assays and in vivo PDX subclinical trials. Through this process, we developed GQ1033 and GQ1030, next-generation ADCs specifically targeting EGFR x cMET and DLL3, respectively.Results:GQ1033 showed potent cytotoxicity in the HCC827 cell line and complete tumor regression at a single 4 mg/kg dose in the NCI-H1975 CDX model. In an osimertinib-resistant NSCLC PDX trial, involving \u223c10 models with diverse EGFR/cMET expression levels, GQ1033 demonstrated robust antitumor activity with an overall ORR of \u223c70%. GQ1030 displayed strong cytotoxicity in DLL3-positive cancer cell lines, with no off-target effects in DLL3-negative cells. In vivo, GQ1030 exhibited robust antitumor activity in the SHP-77 CDX model at a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg. In a PDX trial involving over 10 SCLC models randomly chosen without consideration of DLL3 expression, GQ1030 demonstrated best-in-class potential with an ORR of \u223c80%. The selected lead ADCs did not necessarily possess the highest antibody affinities or the most potent payloads. Furthermore, ADCs with higher DARs did not consistently demonstrate significant efficacy advantages.Conclusions:GQ1033 and GQ1030, developed through high-throughput screening leveraging our iGDC\u2122 and iLDC\u2122 platforms, have demonstrated encouraging efficacy in preclinical studies, suggesting a broader therapeutic index. These next-gen ADCs hold potential as innovative treatments for lung cancers.Citation Format:Sipeng Li, Yajun Sun, Meijun Xiong, Chong Liu, Yanwen Feng, Zengyan Mu, Xinju Gao, Yu Han, Paul H.

    "abstract": "Trophoblast glycoprotein, also known as 5T4, is an oncofetal antigen that is upregulated on a variety of solid tumors including breast, lung, and genitourinary cancers. 5T4 expression levels correlate with stage of cancer progression and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Herein, we describe the pre-clinical design and validation of JK06, a humanized, quadrivalent, biparatopic antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets 5T4, allowing for efficient and selective delivery of a cytotoxic payload, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), to tumor cells. JK06 is engineered from 2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to distinct epitopes of 5T4. The first mAb clone was converted to a single-chain fragment variable (ScFv) format and fused to the C-terminal Fc end of a second mAb. This yields a hybrid molecule with four 5T4 binding sites, targeting two distinct epitopes of the 5T4 antigen. This design increases 5T4 avidity, an important feature given the generally low expression of 5T4 on tumor cells and enhances internalization of the drug. JK06 binds to recombinant 5T4 protein with low picomolar affinity measured by surface plasmon resonance, an approximately 10-fold increase in comparison to the two parental mAbs. JK06 induces internalization into 5T4 expressing tumor cells more rapidly and to a greater extent in vitro, than the parental mAbs. The tubulin inhibitor MMAE was conjugated to the Fc backbone of JK06 in a site-specific manner with a cleavable linker at a drug:antibody ratio (DAR) of two. In vivo CDX studies utilizing the MDA-MB-461 breast cancer and H1975 lung cancer cell lines in nude mice demonstrated that JK06 induces robust control of tumor growth in vivo. A repeat-dose GLP toxicology study, with a once every 3-week (Q3W) dosing schedule, demonstrated that JK06 was well tolerated, and without any observed adverse effects at the tested doses. Toxicokinetic evaluation showed a half-life which projects sustained exposure in humans with a Q3W dosing regimen. JK06 is currently being evaluated in an open-label, dose-escalation and expansion Phase I study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy in a basket of solid tumors known to express 5T4.Citation Format:Jonathan McNally, Binyam Bezabeh, Jijun Dong, Samuel Murphy.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Despite the expanding landscape of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), patient selection remains challenging due to limited liquid biopsy methods for target assessment. Current tissue approaches lack longitudinal assessments and provide insufficient resolution of target expression heterogeneity that could inform ADC selection. We present the first liquid biopsy platform specifically designed for ADC therapy, designed to inform treatment selection through single-cell RNA sequencing of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This platform provides comprehensive profiling of target antigen expression across multiple ADC targets, establishing the foundation for target expression-based ADC selection. Beyond initial target profiling, this approach could provide a foundation for studying target dynamics and potential resistance mechanisms.Methods:10 patients with various solid tumors were consented for research from the observational clinical study CTC-M. Blood samples (3x10mL) were collected and processed using either our proprietary platform or a combination of existing commercial instruments. Individual CTCs were barcoded and analyzed via single-cell RNA sequencing to profile expression of multiple ADC targets (including HER2, TROP2, Nectin-4, and c-MET) along with global transcriptome patterns. Patient demographic and disease characteristics were collected in a de-identified database.Results:Single-cell RNA sequencing of isolated CTCs revealed detection of ADC target expression across various cancers. Our fully automated platform delivers barcoded CTCs ready for single-cell sequencing in under 1 hour compared to 6+ hours for existing workflows, integrating both isolation and molecular barcoding steps. The novel isolation technology achieves a 10-100X improvement in CTC purity versus current methods, overcoming a key technological hurdle compared to other systems. The platform maintains plasma integrity throughout processing, enabling simultaneous CTC and ctDNA analysis from a single blood draw.Conclusions:We have developed the first integrated platform enabling rapid, automated preparation of CTCs for single-cell ADC target profiling. Our workflow demonstrates significant advantages in speed, purity, and cost-effectiveness, while enabling concurrent CTC and ctDNA analysis from a single blood draw. This technology establishes the foundation for comprehensive liquid biopsy-based ADC target assessment, addressing a critical unmet need in precision oncology.Citation Format:Antoine Herzog, Xiaokang Li, Mattia Lazzaroni, Salom\u00e9 Th\u00fcler, Sylvie Andr\u00e9, Marina Alexandre Gaveta, Stefano Varricchio, Olivier Dubey, Bastien Vergnet, Krisztian Homicsko.

    "abstract": "Background:Branched Lewis B/Y (bLeB/Y) is a unique tumor-associated glycan antigen overexpressed in a wide panel of solid tumors including gastric cancer. GNX1021 is a novel bLeB/Y-targeting ADC, linked to the potent antimitotic agent Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via an enzyme-cleavable linker. The mAb backbone of GNX1021 has established safety profile in Ph1 oncology study. Disease control was maintained over 4 months as stable disease in 4/46 advanced solid tumor patients. This study presents in vitro pharmacodynamics and in vivo anti-tumor activity of GNX1021 in multiple gastric cancer models as well as its safety profile in rats.Methods:Target engagement was verified via ELISA, with detailed characterization of cell-binding, internalization, and cytotoxicity. Prevalence of bLeB/Y expression and other therapeutic targets are assessed through IHC over TMAs. Next, the in vivo efficacy was assessed in cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models. MMAE-associated PD markers including Ki67 for cell proliferation and cleaved caspase-3 for apoptosis were characterized with IHC in the tumors isolated from CDX models. Nonclinical safety was evaluated in a pilot repeat-dose study of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.Results:The mAb of GNX1021 showed specific binding to bLeB/Y glycans without cross-reactivity to other types of glycans in ELISA. Among the positive-stained solid tumors, bLeB/Y showed high prevalence in 50% to 60% of overall gastric tumors tested, whereas HER2 had a limited expression in less than 10% of the same cohorts. In vitro cytotoxicity and internalization of GNX1021 was positively correlated with target expression in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, single administration of GNX1021 at low doses exhibited significant in vivo tumor burden reduction activity in high bLeB/Y-expressing gastric models, with sustained efficacy to the study end. The intratumoral activation of cleaved caspase-3 and down-regulation of Ki67 was observed along with tumor control as expected. Furthermore, hematotoxicity of GNX1021 was not detected with weekly administration at a preclinically efficacious low dose over 4 weeks. A mild reduction in neutrophils and reticulocytes was noted as the weekly dose increased to more than the double, while no detectable lesion in bone marrow was correlated with this observation. No obvious sign of hepatic and renal toxicity was identified. In general, GNX1021 was well tolerated in SD rats.Conclusions:GNX1021, a novel glycan-targeting ADC to branched Lewis B/Y, showed promising preclinical efficacy in gastric cancer models and favorable safety profile in SD rats. Through targeting such a unique glycan, GNX1021 demonstrated strong potential to address gastric cancer patients' unmet medical needs for novel targets.Citation Format:Yen-Ying Chen, Chia-Chun Chang, Wen-Han Lee, Ching-Kuei Chen, Ying-Rou Shen, Yu-Ting Lin, Chong-Wei He, Yu-Jeng Wang, Liang-Yirn Liu, Mei-Chun Yang, Tong-Hsuan Chang.

    "abstract": "The combination of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) and Immuno-Oncology (IO) agents is regarded as one of the most exciting and promising trends in the rapidly evolving field of cancer treatment. Affinity Biopharma has developed the Tumor MicroEnviroment Activated (TMEA) platform, with proprietary TMEA linkers applicable in both Small Molecule Drug Conjugates (SMDCs), ADCs and dual-payload ADCs. The TMEA linkers could achieve extracellular activation of payloads in the Tumor MicroEnviroment (TME) by a tumor-specific protease Legumain (AEP), which is an acid endopeptidase with tumor site over-expression and a strict specificity for one particular amino acid (Asn), making it a first-in-class, highly specific and pan-solid tumor target in novel drug design. Compared to GGFG linkers cleaved by lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsins B and L, the TMEA linkers exhibited superior stability in human plasma at 37\u00b0C, and demonstrated higher cleavage efficiency under identical condition in tumor homogenates (pH=6.5), generating a remarkably clean cleavage profile with minimal to no inactive intermediates. Such advantageous characteristics of TMEA linkers could be supported by a TMEA-SMDC drug Legubicin in clinical trial that releases payload Doxorubicin. For dual-payload TMEA-ADCs, each hydrophilic TMEA linker is paired with two insoluble payloads such as TLR7/8 agonists and topoisomerase I inhibitors, which show similar maximum tolerated doses (MTD) in mice as linker-single-payload. Dual-payload TMEA-ADCs have effectively addressed the CMC challenges and enabled homogenous formation of 8-DAR dual-payload design. In various PBMCs-CDX models, dual-payload TMEA-ADCs such as IMD526 (HER2-ADC), IMD2126 (PD-L1-ADC) and IMD2113 (EGFR&TROP2-ADC) have displayed significant dose-dependent antitumor activities and induced complete tumor regressions with no observable toxicities. Compared to mono- or combo treatments with single-payload ADCs, IMD526 validated its superiority in the in-vivo CT26-HER+ syngeneic mouse model, and long-term elimination of detectable tumors was achieved with IMD526 both alone and combined with IMD101 (a TMEA-Cytokine releasing IL-2). In tumor re-challenge studies, mice that were cured exhibited immune memory and were resistant to tumor re-implantation. In non-human primate (NHP) studies, dual-payload TMEA-ADCs showed excellent stability in circulation and a strong safety profile, indicating a greatly expanded therapeutic window. And different from the tumor cell endocytosis activation by GGFG-DXd ADCs, the bio-distribution of TMEA-ADCs resulted in faster and higher levels of payload accumulation in the tumor local tissues. In summary, by integrating antibody targeting, TME activation, cytotoxic therapy, and I/O therapy into one single molecule, the dual-payload TMEA-ADCs has demonstrated the synergistic effects of ADCs conjugated with 16 insoluble payloads from 2 distinct mechanisms of action in tumor models.Citation Format:Cheng Liu, Yuan Liu, Rui Zhang.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a cutting-edge class of targeted cancer therapeutics, seamlessly integrating the high specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the cytotoxic power of chemotherapy agents. This strategic union facilitates the precise delivery of a potent cytotoxic payload to HER2-expressing cancer cells, where HER2 is a well-established therapeutic target. Despite the promising efficacy of HER2-directed ADCs in treating HER2-positive breast cancer, the emergence of resistance in tumor cells poses a significant obstacle to their therapeutic potential.The present study is designed to meticulously assess the anti-tumor efficacy of HER2-targeted ADCs across a diverse panel of cancer cell lines exhibiting varying levels of HER2 expression. Furthermore, to delve into the complexities of resistance, we have developed in vitro models of resistance by subjecting cells to cyclical exposure to DS-8201, a leading HER2-targeted ADC, and its payload, Dxd. Our findings reveal a pronounced inhibitory effect of HER2-targeted ADCs on HER2-positive cancer cell lines, underscoring their selective cytotoxicity. A critical insight from our research is the observation of a significant reduction in HER2 protein levels in cell lines that have developed resistance. This decrease is hypothesized to be a key factor in the resistance mechanism, potentially by limiting the availability of the target for ADC binding. The elucidation of these resistance mechanisms is pivotal, as it informs the strategic development of next-generation HER2-targeted therapies. By addressing the issue of resistance, we aim to enhance the efficacy of HER2-targeted treatments and ultimately improve patient outcomes in the battle against breast cancer.Citation Format:Lili Chai, Taotao Cao, Xue Yang, Wei Liu, Zhengtai Li, Xiaojian Wang, Tj (Tiejun) Bing.

    "abstract": "PYX-201, a first-in-concept non-cellular targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), is currently being tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial in a variety of solid tumors (NCT05720117). PYX-201 is designed to bind specifically to the extra-domain B splice variant of fibronectin (EDB+FN), a component of the extracellular matrix found in various solid tumors with absent or low expression in normal adult tissue (Hooper, 2022). Extracellular proteases can cleave the valine-citrulline peptide linker to release the optimized toxic payload Auristatin0101 into the tumor microenvironment which diffuses into tumor cells and induces cell killing. A comprehensive mini-trial study has been conducted to measure PYX-201 anti-tumor efficacy in multiple patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models selected from ten solid tumor indications. Building on our previous analysis (Severe, 2024), full mini-trial results demonstrate that PYX-201 (3mg/kg, Q4Dx4) was well tolerated and resulted in broad anti-tumor activity as calculated by the Tumor Growth Inhibition percentage (%TGI) at study end for each individual PDX model. Our results show that 25% were non-responders (TGI<25%), 30% moderate (25%<TGI<70%), 20% strong (70%<TGI<90%) and 25% very strong responders (TGI>90%). Remarkably, PDX models with very strong PYX-201 responses (TGI>90%) were found across 9/10 solid tumor indications. Additionally, mice with complete responses to PYX-201 (tumor volume reached 0mm3 for at least two consecutive measurements) were found across several tumor indications. To investigate gene expression changes relevant to PYX-201 mechanism of action, a satellite mouse was included on study for tumor collection for each PDX model prior to treatment. To determine which gene signatures may be associated with PYX-201 response, analysis was performed on RNA extracted from satellite tumor samples. The Nanostring ADC Development panel was selected for expression analysis across 750 human genes. A comparison between PDX models with very strong PYX-201 responses (TGI>90%) to PYX-201 non-responders (TGI<25%) with all tumor indications combined identified several genes which were differentially expressed. In addition, gene set analysis was performed to identify gene categories which were associated with PYX-201 response. The gene sets with the greatest number of differentially expressed genes in our analysis were tumor stroma and enzymes, indicating these categories are important for PYX-201 response in pre-clinical PDX models. Overall, PYX-201 showed broad anti-tumor activity in PDX pre-clinical models, suggesting it is a promising ADC for further testing across solid tumor indications. Furthermore, tumor stroma and protease genes were associated with PYX-201 activity in PDX models, providing further insight into PYX-201 mechanism of action.Citation Format:Amanda Facklam, Justin Trickett, Sara Lewandowski, Chuan Shen, Frank Wang, Marsha Crochiere, Nicolas Severe, Jan Pinkas.

    "abstract": "Background:Claudins are a family of tight junction proteins characterized by four transmembrane domains, with critical roles in epithelial cell junction formation. While claudins localize to tight junctions in healthy tissues, their overexpression in solid tumors leads to aberrant exposure outside of these junctions, making them attractive targets for ADC therapies. CLDN1, in particular, is overexpressed in several solid tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its expression correlates with tumor proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis. Here, we developed a novel CLDN1-targeting ADC, MW-C1, that has shown potent anti-tumor activity across various preclinical models, along with an encouraging safety profile in non-human primates (NHPs).Methods:MW-C1 was engineered by conjugating monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to a CLDN1-targeting monoclonal antibody using site-specific interchain-disulfide conjugation technology and a cleavable linker, resulting in a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4. In vitro, the internalization and cytotoxicity of MW-C1 were assessed in SCC4, Cal27, Huh7, and OVCAR3 cell lines, which express varying levels of CLDN1. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in multiple cell-line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys.Results:CLDN1 was found to be overexpressed in 85.7% of HNSCC, 91.7% of HCC, 58% of LUSC, and 77% of cervical cancer samples. MW-C1 demonstrated robust binding, rapid internalization, and potent cytotoxicity in CLDN1-positive cancer cell lines. In in vivo studies, MW-C1 induced significant and durable tumor regression in both CDX and PDX models, with varying CLDN1 expression levels. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed favorable properties for MW-C1 in both mice and cynomolgus monkeys, which were attributed to its optimized biophysical characteristics and site-specific conjugation. In a non-GLP NHP toxicology study, MW-C1 was well tolerated, with no significant off-target toxicity or adverse events observed.Conclusions:MW-C1 demonstrated potent anti-tumor efficacy and a favorable safety profile, highlighting its potential as a transformative therapeutic candidate for the treatment of CLDN1-overexpressing malignancies.Citation Format:Zhongfei Li, Jun Yang, Peng Fang, Rongrong Hu, Cuicui Guo, Xiaoding Tan, Hai Wu, Xun Gui.

    "abstract": "TROP2 is a ubiquitously expressed tumor-associated antigen. Its expression in normal tissues such as skin, oral mucosa, esophagus, liver, and cornea severely limits the development of anti-TROP2 ADCs. It is difficult to balance the efficacy and toxicity to obtain a larger therapeutic window. In clinical, Dato-DXd, Trodelvy and SKB264 showed obvious on-target toxicity or off-target toxicity, which affect clinical development and patient benefit. To address the unmet needs, we developed the SYS6042, an ADC composed of an anti-TROP2 pH-sensitive antibody, a tetrapeptide-based stable linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. It binds TROP2 with nanomolar affinity at pH 6.0 but hardly binds the target at pH 7.4, thereby reducing on-target toxicity. In several cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) models, a single dose of SYS6042 at 0.4 - 4.0 mg/kg exhibited remarkable tumor growth inhibition. Notably, the antitumor activity of SYS6042 was superior to homemade Dato-DXd and SKB264. In exploratory toxicology study, SYS6042 showed favorable PK and good safety profiles with toxic findings unrelated to on-target toxicity(hematotoxicity) despite high levels of TROP2 expression in normal tissues of cynomolgus monkey. The highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) for monkeys was defined as 30 mg/kg for repeating dosing. Based on these results, it demonstrates that the novel design of SYS6042 leads to an improved therapeutic window, which would help address unmet needs in the treatments of TROP2-positive tumors.Citation Format:Yancui Wang, Xiao Gao, Mo Dan, Xiwu Hui, Bing Yao, Yang Zhang, Congcong Niu, Can Yuan, Xiaoque Zhu, Zhaopeng Sun, Bin Kang, Miaomiao Wei.

    "abstract": "Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) have achieved great success as anti-cancer therapies, with 15 ADC drugs approved in global market. Despite the initial response to ADC treatment, drug resistance and tumor relapse inevitably happen due to the high heterogeneity in advanced tumors. The mechanism of resistance can be due to downregulation of drug targets, upregulation of multi-drug resistance mechanisms, such as ABCB1/ABCG2 and others. Overcoming these resistance mechanisms are a big challenge to next-generation ADC development for cancer therapy. To address these challenges, MediLink has developed an innovative dual-payload ADC with two payloads of different MOAs: a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor and a tubulin inhibitor. Two conjugation methods were developed: (1) Tubulin inhibitor payload-linkers were conjugated at specific lysine sites of antibody while Topo1i payload-linker were conjugated with free cysteine thiols via TMALIN\u00ae Technology, resulting in a dual-payload ADC with DAR of 2 and 8 for each payload-linker, respectively. (2) Reduced antibody conjugates with pre-mixed or step wisely added Topo1i payload linker and Tubulin payload linker in different proportions to obtain any desired ratio of the two different payloads. ADC characterization showed good stability, homogeneity and precise DAR values for the conjugation of both payload-linkers to Trastuzumab. In vitro, the dual-payload Her2 ADC demonstrated strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells with different levels of Her2 expression, especially in cells overexpressing ABCB1 and ABCG2, and Enhertu-resistant tumor cells. In vivo, the dual-payload ADC exhibited superior efficacy in Enhertu-resistance CDX model and Her2 low CDX models. In summary, we developed dual-payload ADCs with intention for resolving topo1 inhibitor induced tumor resistance issues. The dual-payload Her2 ADC demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities, showing the potential to overcome the multidrug resistant mechanism and Enhertu resistance.Citation Format:Ailin Shan, Chun Deng, Peng Zou, Shuai Song, Jiaqiang Cai, Tongtong Xue.

    "abstract": "As oncology treatments increase in molecular complexity, the need for biomarkers continues to grow. This becomes critical in treatments such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC\u2019s), which are a promising targeted anti-cancer therapy, that not all patients respond equally well to. Though prior work suggests that patients who over-express ADC targets relative to those that do not are more likely to benefit from ADC therapy, a robust biomarker signature that predicts response has yet to be defined for most ADCs. To address this unmet need, we developed an approach to impute composite warhead-target ADC biomarkers from digitized histopathology (H&E) slides.The first component of this biomarker signature is a machine learning model that imputes ADC target RNA expression from histopathology slides. Flash frozen and FFPE histopathology slides from 11, 115 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 2, 732 patients from Aster across 32 tumor types were embedded to a lower dimensional representation via the DINO ViT model. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) was trained within each tumor type to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression (19, 421 protein-coding genes) from these embedding vectors, achieving a mean spearman r = 0.20+/-0.17 across all genes (mean pearson r = 0.21+/-0.18), and a mean spearman r = 0.32 +/- 0.17 across the top 1000 genes across cohorts. Improved performance was observed when imputing a weighted sum of expression for transcriptomically correlated genes (as ascertained via differential expression analysis) for a suite of 346 known candidate ADC targets.The second component of the biomarker signature focuses on stratifying longitudinal outcomes in patients treated with topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitors. We developed a gene signature (weighted mean expression of 52 genes) based on treatment response in cell lines (GDSC2) and therapy-agnostic patient gene expression profiles (TCGA, Aster). Additional weighting based on cross-modality evidence was employed. The resulting signatures were associated with longitudinal endpoints in primary and metastatic colorectal cancer patients. An MLP was subsequently trained within the TCGA and Aster cohorts to impute the TOP1 signature from H&E datasets, achieving cross-validation spearman correlation of 0.42 within the COAD-READ cohort and a spearman R of 0.29 in a held-out MRC FOCUS test set (N=73).In summary, the combined warhead-target imputation signature shows promise in stratifying likely ADC treatment responders from non-responders. Given that assays directly measuring gene expression at the bulk and single cell level are still seldom used in the clinic, this imputation model may provide a useful tool to leverage H&E imaging routinely performed as part of patient diagnosis as a tool to inform treatment selection.Citation Format:Anna Shcherbina, Yajas Shah, Zachary McCaw, Yang Su, Serra Elliott, David Light, Angela Oliveira Pisco, Sanjana Narayanan, Chaya Wurman, Vincent Luckzow, Christopher Probert, Sacha Holland, Virginia Donovan, Peter Szabo.

    "abstract": "Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is a cell-surface glycoprotein overexpressed in various solid tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (HR+ BC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TROP2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as Sacituzumab-govitecan (SG) and Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) demonstrated promising clinical efficacy in patients with TROP2-positive cancers. However, TROP2-targeting ADCs exhibit a high incidence of adverse events, a short duration of response, and frequent recurrence. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for treatments beyond ADC therapeutics, particularly for ADC-na\u00efve and ADC-refractory patients.ABN202 is an antibody-cytokine fusion protein platform that fuses a potent cytotoxic and immune-modulating cytokine, interferon-beta mutein (IFN-\u03b2 mutein), with an antibody via flexible protein linker. In previous studies, ABN202 utilizing the TROP2-targeting antibody, Sacituzumab (ABN202, \u03b1TROP2), demonstrated potent anti-tumor efficacy by inhibiting cancer cell growth and activating anti-tumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we compared the in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of ABN202 (\u03b1TROP2) with those of SG and Dato-DXd in ADC-resistant preclinical models, as well as in xenograft and human IFNAR knock-in (hIFNAR KI) mouse models. The preclinical toxicity profiles of SG, Dato-DXd, and ABN202 (\u03b1TROP2) were evaluated using human immune cells and hIFNAR KI mouse models.In conclusion, ABN202 (\u03b1TROP2) demonstrated potent anti-cancer efficacy and a tolerable safety profile compared to SG and Dato-DXd. Our findings suggest that ABN202 (\u03b1TROP2) represents a novel therapeutic approach beyond ADCs for both ADC-na\u00efve and ADC-refractory cancers.Citation Format:Hee Geon Park, Hyun Kyung Lee, Myeung Ryun Seo, Soo Jin Ryu, Sungyoul Hong, Chan Gyu Lee, Hae Min Jeong, Sae Hyung Lee, Na Young Kim, Young Kee Shin, Jun Young Choi.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have recently made significant advancements in cancer treatment, particularly for solid tumors. Among the multiple mechanisms of action of ADC drugs, the bystander effect\u2014where the cytotoxic payloads released by the antibodies diffuse into and kill nearby tumor cells\u2014plays a crucial role, especially in tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression. Therefore, constructing an antigen heterogeneity model for evaluating this bystander killing effect is essential for the preclinical assessment of ADC drugs. To establish a stable Trop-2 antigen expression heterogeneity model, we deleted Trop-2 in the Trop-2-positive NCI-H292 cell line and selected a clone with a similar in vitro proliferation rate to the parental cells. Additionally, to distinguish Trop-2-negative from Trop-2-positive cells in both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we introduced luciferase and mCherry into the Trop-2-negative cells. In vitro, Trop-2-negative and Trop-2-positive cells were mixed in multiple ratios and treated with graded concentrations of anti-Trop-2 ADC. After five days, flow cytometry quantified Trop-2-negative cells to evaluate the bystander killing effect. in vivo, Trop-2-positive and Trop-2-negative cells were mixed in various ratios and implanted subcutaneously in mice, followed by intravenous drug administration. Tumor volume and bioluminescence were measured to assess the efficacy of the anti-Trop-2 ADC and bystander killing activity. The results showed that the anti-Trop-2 ADC exhibited a significant bystander killing effect, significantly inhibiting Trop-2-negative cells both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, we have successfully established an isogeneic Trop-2 expression heterogeneity model and validated the bystander killing activity of anti-Trop-2 ADCs in vitro and in vivo. This model provides a robust platform for the pharmacological and efficacy assessment of anti-Trop-2 ADC therapies.Citation Format:Jingwei Huang, Xiangyi Wang, Zhixiang Zhang, Jingxuan Yan, Jinyan Ma, Man Zhang, Qingyang Gu.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are one of the fastest-growing therapeutic modalities, with 11 FDA-approved ADCs and more than 250 different ADCs in clinical development. Despite their success, significant hurdles remain. Notably, translating preclinical findings to the clinic remains challenging. Hematological toxicities are commonly associated with many ADCs and may arise from the direct killing of hematopoietic cells by the ADC itself or indirectly from payload released elsewhere in the body. Therefore, development of in vitro assays capable of predicting clinical findings could help improve ADC development and guide the selection of optimal linkers and payloads.Different ADCs were generated by conjugating targeted and non-targeted antibodies to a common microtubule inhibitor, while varying the protease-cleavable linkers. Clinically approved ADCs spanning different payload classes were used as benchmarks. ADC cytotoxicity was evaluated in both antigen-positive and antigen-negative cancer cell lines in vitro. Lysosomal cleavage of different linkers was evaluated in-vitro. ADC linker stability was also evaluated via a neutrophil differentiation assay, using expanded and differentiated CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, which were treated with various ADCs before assessing CD66b neutrophil maturation. Finally, in vitro off-target toxicity was evaluated using a colony forming cell (CFC) assay to assess cytotoxicity of ADCs and their payloads on erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocyte progenitors differentiated from hematopoietic stem cells.In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed variable potency among the ADCs tested. Some linkers (e.g., VK, FK) resulted in potent ADC cytotoxicity irrespective of the targeting antibody, while others (e.g., VA, VCit, GGFG, K) had target-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. We identified linkers with different payload release rates in lysosomes, where GGFG and K showed the slowest rates. In vitro off-target and linker stability assays highlight how ADCs may induce toxicity in different healthy cell subsets depending on the ADC components (antibody, linker, and payload). In addition, by comparing results for ADCs and payloads, it is also possible to estimate if these toxicities are likely driven by the conjugated drug, the payload, or both. These results underlined how off-target toxicity and neutrophil differentiation assay may be useful during preclinical development to identify potential off-target effects and to improve the translation of ADC from preclinical to clinical settings.Citation Format:Yongzhao Huang, Emer Clarke, Graham A.

    "abstract": "Background:HDP-201 is a novel multimeric linker ADC directed against GCC based on topoisomerase 1 inhibitor exatecan. GCC is highly expressed in gastrointestinal malignancies including gastric and colorectal cancers. The multimeric linker-payload featured with a solubility enhancer facilitates the delivery of more than one hydrophobic payload per conjugation site. HDP-201 employs a proprietary, site-specific conjugation technology based on cysteine-engineered and Fc-silenced antibodies which are devoid of Fc-mediated uptake.Methods:The cysteine-reactive multimeric exatecan-linker construct was synthesized at Heidelberg Pharma and site-specifically conjugated to engineered cysteine residues of a proprietary anti-GCC antibody, yielding ADCs with a DOL of 2.0 and a DAR of 4.0. HDP-201 potency was tested in cytotoxicity assays using a GCC-overexpressing HEK293-GUCY2C cell line. The anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated in subcutaneous HEK293-GUCY2C tumor models in female NOD SCID mice, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) treated intravenously with single and multiple doses of HDP-201. Safety and tolerability of HDP-201 was assessed in cynomolgus monkeys.Results:HDP-201 showed favorable in vitro cytotoxicity, with nanomolar activity against the GCC-expressing cell line and no cytotoxicity against target-negative cells. A potent by-stander effect of HDP-201 was demonstrated in co-culture experiments with target-positive and -negative cells, indicating its potential to treat tumors with heterogenous target expression. In mouse xenograft models, intravenous HDP-201 single dose treatment resulted in complete tumor remission in HEK293-GUCY2C xenografts. In gastrointestinal PDX models, HDP-201 significantly inhibited tumor growth. Multiple dosing further enhanced this anti-tumor efficacy without impacting toxicity. In cynomolgus monkeys, a single intravenous dose of 60 mg/kg was well tolerated without severe clinical signs and only transient changes in hematology and serum chemistry parameters.Conclusion:Targeted delivery of topoisomerase 1 inhibitor to GCC-positive cells was achieved using HDP-201 comprised of an anti-GCC antibody conjugated to a multimeric linker-exatecan. HDP-201 showed target-specific potency, strong anti-tumor efficacy, and high tolerability in preclinical models. The use of HDP-201 in the therapy of GCC-positive gastrointestinal malignancies represents a promising approach in cancer treatment.Citation Format:Sarah Jane Neuberth, Christian Orlik, Hendrik Gruss, Christoph Mueller, Kristin Decker, Nick Neubacher, Marisa Schmitt, Anik\u00f3 P\u00e1lfi, Irina Dranova, Michael Kulke, Andreas Pahl, Torsten Hechler HDP-201 - a novel multimeric linker exatecan-based ADC targeting Guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) for treatment of gastrointestinal malignancies [abstract].

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a distinguished class of anticancer therapeutics. ADCs targeting Trophoblast Cell Surface Antigen 2 (TROP2) have shown efficacy in treating various epithelial tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) serves as both an immune checkpoint and a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), commonly overexpressed in diverse tumor types. Growing evidence showed that ADCs can increase the efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents by multiple mechanisms, such as induction of immunogenic cell death, dendritic cell maturation, increase of T cell infiltration and expression of immune-regulatory proteins including PD-L1 and MHC. Both preclinical and early clinical studies suggest that ADCs and immunotherapy are promising combination options for tumor treatment. IBI3014 is an innovative TROP2 and PD-L1 dual-targeting ADC, comprising a humanized bispecific antibody linked to a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, NT1, via a cleavable linker. In vitro studies demonstrated the unconjugated bispecific antibody of IBI3014 has potent internalization activity potent immune checkpoint blocking activity. IBI3014 demonstrated superior cytotoxicity to benchmark and parental ADCs across several cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models with different TROP2 and PD-L1 expression pattern, offering broader tumor type coverage. IBI3014 showed acceptable stability profile in mice and monkeys and can be well tolerated in monkeys with a highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) of 50 mg/kg. Conclusion: IBI3014 represents a first-in-class bispecific ADC that integrates targeted cytotoxicity with checkpoint blockade within a single molecule. This dual mechanism of action not only enhances therapeutic efficacy but also maintains a favorable safety profile, which provides a promising approach for cancer therapy.Citation Format:Xiguang Zhang, Yanping Jin, Jinchang Lu, Ninghuan Li, Zhihai Wu, Min Wu, Yan Bian, Fenggen Fu, Weiwei Wu, Shuaixiang Zhou, Huizhong Xiong.

    "abstract": "KA-3123-LD38 is a novel bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) designed to target both EGFR and B7H3, two markers that are highly expressed in various tumor cells but have limited expression in normal tissues. The co-expression of EGFR and B7H3 in tumor cells is particularly high, making them promising therapeutic targets. By targeting both of these markers simultaneously, KA-3123-LD38 aims to reduce the risk of \"on-target/off-tumor\" cytotoxicity, a common side effect in cancer therapies. This ADC is a IgG1 with a common light chain, conjugated with LD-38, an Escugen proprietary ADC platform composed of TopIi payload and highly hydrophilic stable cleavable linker. KA-3123-LD38 binds to B7H3 with high affinity, with a Kd of less than 0.01 nM, while its affinity for EGFR is weaker, with a Kd greater than 10 nM. When compared to monoclonal antibodies targeting B7H3, KA-3123-LD38 exhibits a significantly faster internalization rate in tumor cells that co-express EGFR and B7H3. In vitro assays show that KA-3123-LD38 effectively induces cytotoxicity in tumor cells expressing either EGFR and B7H3 together or B7H3 alone. However, the cytotoxic effect is notably stronger in cells co-expressing both targets. Furthermore, KA-3123-LD38 demonstrates strong bystander killing activity, further enhancing its therapeutic potential. In xenograft mouse models, KA-3123-LD38 strongly inhibits the growth of a variety of tumor types, including NSCLC, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer. Ongoing toxicity studies suggest that KA-3123-LD38 has a favorable safety profile, with low toxicity observed. These promising results highlight KA-3123-LD38 as a potentially powerful treatment for a broad range of solid tumors.Citation Format:Guojin Wu, Chuanying Xu, Weihong Nian, Zhengcheng Guo, Jiabei Liang, Feng He, Qing Zhou.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, exemplified by the clinical success of HER2-targeting ADCs like Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan (T-Dxd), which demonstrates efficacy across a spectrum of HER2 expression levels. However, ADC development remains challenging due to translational gaps between preclinical and clinical findings. This study introduces a robust translational approach for ADC evaluation, combining a single-mouse preclinical model using MiniPDX\u00ae technology with Bayesian statistical analysis\u2014a widely recognized and commonly applied statistical approach in clinical research. Bayesian analysis offers the advantage of integrating prior knowledge with experimental data to generate probabilistic predictions, providing a dynamic and nuanced understanding of treatment efficacy. Our study mimics clinical trials of T-Dxd and Trastuzumab-Emtansine (T-DM1) using this robust, translational framework to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical evaluation.Methods:We selected 20 PDX models over six cancer types, representing HER2 expression levels (high, medium, low, and negative control). Tumor tissues were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and implanted subcutaneously in mice via MiniPDX capsules. Each mouse received a single 10 mg/kg dose of T-Dxd or T-DM1 over 10 days. Tumor cell viability was assessed using CellTiter-Glo, and tumor relative proliferation rate was calculated as Treatment/Control ratios (T/C%). A T/C ratio <50% indicated significant response. Bayesian modelling was applied to estimate the probability of tumor inhibition across HER2 cohorts.Results:T-Dxd demonstrated a 100% overall response rate (ORR) in HER2-high models, with significant tumor inhibition. Additionally, T-Dxd exhibited substantial efficacy in HER2-medium (ORR 75%) and HER2-low (ORR 60%) groups. In contrast, T-DM1 displayed strong tumor inhibition in HER2-high models but limited efficacy in HER2-medium and HER2-low groups. In addition, Bayesian analysis yielded posterior probabilities of 83%, 66%, and 54% that T-Dxd slows down tumor growth by 50% when compared to control for the HER2-high, HER2-medium, and HER2-low groups, respectively.Conclusion:Our study demonstrates the feasibility and promising results of preclinical single-mouse trials using MiniPDX\u00ae. The Bayesian statistical analysis provides a rich summary of the effects of T-Dxd and T-DM1. This approach bridges the translational gap, offering a platform to predict ADC efficacy and guide candidate selection in the preclinical setting.Citation Format:Diandong Jiang, Yuan Ji, Jiaxin Liu, Bin Xie, Hongkui Chen, Shizhu Zhao, Le Li, Yu Di, Xinlei Chen, Xiaorong Gu, Huanhuan Zhang, Zhenle Bi, Kaimeng Hu, Loc Van, Josh Caggiula, Yulan Tang, Danyi Wen.

    "abstract": "Background:Predictive biomarkers for multiple ADCs/tumor types (beyond 3+ HER2 IHC) are lacking. We previously reported the discovery of ADC TRS\u2014an algorithm combining individual ADC target expression, proliferation, and adhesion by RNAseq to predict ADC clinical benefit across tumor types/targets\u2014and association with OS after ADC treatment (Abstract 3140, ASCO 2024). Here we evaluated the final ADC TRS biomarker (ADC-specific; tuned on >100 tumor type/ADC RRs) by a qRT-PCR based clinical trial assay (CTA) for predicting ADC clinical benefit.Methods:Adults in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) system with advanced bladder or breast cancer in an observational trial (NCT03061305) who were treated with an approved ADC (enfortumab vedotin [EV], sacituzumab govitecan [SG] or trastuzumab deruxtecan [T-DXd]; first dose by Apr. 21, 2023) with valid CTA TRS results from FFPE tissue (collected prior to 1st ADC treatment) were eligible; patients with prior trastuzumab or hormonal (between tissue collection/ ADC start) treatment were excluded. KPNC oncologists (blinded to ADC TRS status) determined best response to therapy from chart review. ADC TRS status (+ vs. -) / response data were merged by the KPNC statistician and analyzed per a prespecified plan.Results:A total of 117 KPNC patients with advanced bladder (n=58 [50%]) or breast (n=59 [50%]) cancer treated with an approved ADC (n= 56 [48%], 47 [40%], and 14 [12%] EV, SG, and T-DXd, respectively) were evaluable for TRS and RR. As shown in theTable, TRS+ status was associated with significantly higher RR and longer PFS and OS for approved ADC treatment; results were generally similar across ADCs and tumor type.Conclusions:By a qRT-PCR based CTA, TRS+ status was associated with improved RR, PFS and OS for approved ADCs in an observational cohort of patients with advanced bladder or breast cancer. Prospective validation for approved and/or investigational ADCs is warranted.

    "abstract": "Emerging data suggest that IO-ADC combinations may lead to better patient outcomes. BNT327 (also known as PM8002) is an investigational anti-PD-L1 x VEGF-A bispecific antibody that has shown encouraging efficacy and tolerability across tumor types, including \u201ccold\u201d tumors not generally responsive to IO therapies (eg, low PD-L1 levels) (Wu J, SABCS 2024 PS3-08; Wu YL, ESMO 2024 1255MO). BNT325 (also known as DB-1305) is an investigational topoisomerase-I-inhibitor-based anti-TROP2 ADC that has so far shown manageable safety and encouraging early clinical activity (Rubinstein M, SGO 2025). The combination of BNT327 with BNT325 may allow for improved efficacy without compounding overlapping toxicities. The monotherapy safety profiles are characterized by low-grade proteinuria, hypertension, and elevated transaminases (BNT327; Guo Y, ASCO 2023 #414802) and stomatitis (BNT325; Marathe O, ESMO 2023 689P). Herein we provide evidence of early preclinical and clinical data to support the novel combination of an anti-PD-L1 x VEGF-A bispecific antibody with an ADC. Preclinical in vivo models testing the combination of BNT327 with BNT325 showed superior tumor growth inhibition (TGI) compared with each treatment alone. In a xenograft A375 + PBMC co-injection model (hTROP2+A375 in B.NDG B2M KO plus mice), the combination of BNT325 (1 mg/kg Q2D*5) and BNT327 (20 mg/kg Q2D*2) had TGI of 111.3% vs. 33.6% for BNT325 or 78.2% for BNT327 alone. In a syngeneic hTROP2+MC38 model, BNT325 (20 mg/kg QW*4) combined with a surrogate BNT327 (surBNT327, anti-mPD-L1 x mVEGF) showed TGI of 106.1% and 106.9% for surBNT327 (5 mg/kg Q2D*4 and 20 mg/kg Q2D*4, respectively) vs. 51.4% for BNT325 alone or 47.6% for surBNT327 (5 mg/kg) and 71.4% for surBNT327 (20 mg/kg) alone. In the clinic, as of Nov 21, 2024, 8 patients (breast cancer n=2, ovarian cancer n=2, other n=4) have received the combination of BNT327 and BNT325 in an ongoing first-in-human phase 1/2a study of patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT05438329). No DLTs were reported in the DLT-evaluable patients (first 6 patients). Stomatitis was reported in 6/8 patients (Grade 3 in 2 patients), which led to a dose reduction of BNT325 in 3 patients. There were no adverse events leading to dose discontinuation. Tumor response analyses and biomarker testing are ongoing. Overall BNT327 plus BNT325 demonstrated superior anti-tumor effects preclinically compared to each drug alone. Early clinical data showed successful dose escalation allowing enrollment to NSCLC, TNBC, ovarian, and cervical cancer expansion cohorts, with updated clinical data planned to be presented. Further evaluation is ongoing of BNT327 with ADCs against HER2 (BNT323/DB-1303), B7H3 (BNT324/DB-1311) and HER3 (BNT326/YL202), with a focus on tumors where early monotherapy efficacy has been observed with these ADCs.Citation Format:Erika P.

    "abstract": "Aberrant O-glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer and can be used to improve druggability of targets for cancer immunotherapy. Tumors express cell surface proteins decorated with truncated O-glycans like Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF), Thomsen-nouveau (Tn) or sialylated Tn (sTn) antigens, which are virtually absent from normal tissues. Development of therapeutic mAbs against these hapten glycotopes is often hampered by weak affinities and low specificity, whereas peptide epitope targeting mAbs usually cannot distinguish between normal and tumor tissue. Both drawbacks can be circumvented by addressing combined protein/carbohydrate epitopes with mAbs that enable high affinity binding and high tumor specificity at the same time. We generated mAb GT-008 recognizing the glycoprotein CD24 with fundamental role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, which is expressed on solid tumors, but also on healthy immune cells and tissues. GT-008 binds CD24 only in presence of a tumor-associated glycosylation thereby leading to reduced binding of the protein expressed on healthy cells.GT-008 was generated by immunization and single B cell cloning using different on- and off-target glycoforms for selection and screening. Binding and tumor selectivity were analyzed by ELISA, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry on healthy and tumor tissues. Functionality was investigated by in vitro internalization and cytotoxicity assays with tumor and healthy cells. Compared to a conventional glycosylation-independent control antibody, GT-008 binds the protein target only in presence of TF O-glycosylation, but not the non-glycosylated protein, other glycoproteins carrying TF nor a synthetic TF O-glycoconjugate. GT-008 differentiates against the sialylated glycoform present on normal tissues. This leads to reduced binding to healthy human immune cells and tissues compared to the control mAb, whereas binding to cancer tissues from different indications (e.g. endometrium, breast, ovarian, prostate, a.o.) was retained. Additionally, its glycosylation dependent binding translates into tumor-selective internalization of GT-008 in vitro while sparing out CD24-positive immune cells. GT-008 has the potential to overcome limitations of conventional protein-targeting mAbs currently in clinical development by circumventing immune cell depletion and on-target/off-tumor toxicities associated with target expression on healthy cells. With its improved therapeutic window due to the strong differentiation between healthy and tumor tissue, GT-008 is exceptionally suitable for different therapeutic modalities, such as drug delivery (ADC, RIT) or cellular therapies (CARs). An in vitro and in vivo proof-of-concept study as therapeutic radioimmunoconjugate has been initiated.Citation Format:Johanna Gellert, Andreas Franz, Manon Weis, Evelyn Hartung, Stephanie Gurka, Antje Danielczyk, Lisa Wei\u00df, Patrik Kehler.

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer remains a leading cause of mortality in men. Despite significant advances in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), there remains a need for more durable treatment options with improved quality of life. STEAP1 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1) is a validated tumor-associated antigen, highly expressed in various solid tumors, including prostate cancer, with restricted expression in normal tissues. Most noteworthy, STEAP1 expression is sustained in metastatic sites and expressed even in PSMA-negative patients, thus potentially providing an opportunity of a targeted therapeutic approach to the majority of patients with mCRPC. ADRX-0405 is a novel STEAP1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), consisting of a humanized IgG1 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase inhibitor via a novel and stable cleavable linker at a drug-to-antibody ratio of 8 (DAR8). ADRX-0405 specifically binds STEAP1, induces H2AX phosphorylation and PARP cleavage in line with its payload mechanism of action, resulting in nanomolar and target-dependent cytotoxicity in tumor cells. In addition, ADRX-0405 exhibits a potent bystander activity, which translates to robust in vivo efficacy in xenograft models of prostate cancer with both high and low target expression. In a mouse clinical trial of patient-derived xenografts with varying STEAP1 expression levels, ADRX-0405 achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 83%. Detailed PD characterization study of ADRX-0405 confirms its mechanism of action as a DNA topoisomerase inhibitor, inducing apoptosis through increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and pH2AX. Notably, ADRX-0405 treatment also leads to upregulation of PD-L1 expression as a result of immunogenic cell death. DNA damage inducers such as topoisomerase inhibitors are known to synergize with DNA damage repair inhibitors such as PARP inhibitors. ADRX-0405 exhibited a strong synergistic effect on tumor growth when combined with PARP inhibitors, thus providing a compelling rationale for clinical combination opportunities. A payload distribution study in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated improved delivery of the payload to tumors over normal tissues and plasma driven by its excellent stability and PK profile. Compared to a STEAP1 antibody conjugated to deruxtecan, the estimated safety margin as determined by the ratio of free payload in tumor over normal tissues was improved by 2-3-fold. Consequently, ADRX-0405 was well tolerated in non-human primates repeat-dose toxicology evaluation. Strikingly, no toxicity was detected in the lungs, which is a known safety liability for the topoisomerase inhibitor payload class. In summary, the preclinical efficacy and safety profile of ADRX-0405 strongly supports its clinical evaluation in mCRPC. A phase 1a/b study with ADRX-0405 is initiated.Citation Format:Maria Shahmoradgoli, Andrew M. Hau, Oscar Betancourt, Felipe Acosta, Sam Janssen, Paul Datta, Anna Y. Wang, Peter P.

    "abstract": "The complement system is a crucial component of the innate immune response, enhancing the body's ability to clear pathogens and damaged cells. It facilitates immune defense mechanisms by promoting inflammation, opsonization, and direct lysis of target cells through the formation of membrane attack complexes (MACs). However, therapeutic antibodies designed to exploit complement-mediated cytotoxicity have faced limitations, including dependence on antigen density, structural constraints related to antibody binding orientation, and the inhibition of complement activation by regulatory molecules expressed on target cells. To address these challenges, we developed a modular IgG-based bispecific antibody platform that engages the complement-initiating protein C1q by fusing anti-C1q variable heavy chain domains (VHHs) to either the heavy or light chains of IgGs. In this study, we present data demonstrating the broad applicability of our platform by enhancing existing complement-deficient antibodies that target a diverse range of clinically relevant tumor antigens with C1q engagers. The resulting bispecific complement engagers (BiCEs) effectively engage C1q and induce robust complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of target antigens with superior efficacy compared to competing technologies. Moreover, the BiCE molecules retain binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and Fc gamma receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs), resulting in an extended half-life and preservation of secondary effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). Our findings suggest that effective activation of the complement system through complement engagers offers a promising alternative to antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and T-cell therapies, providing an opportunity to target antigens with lower tumor specificity and potentially expanding therapeutic options for patients with cancer.Citation Format:Mikael Winkler, Dennis Pedersen, Heidi Gytz, Troels Kj\u00e6r, Nina Dybdal, Alex Ferapontov, Sara Dam, Laust Bavnh\u00f8j, Sofia M\u00f8lgaard, Pascal Merchiers, Mikkel Wandahl Pedersen, Nick Laursen.

    "abstract": "Purpose:The swift and precise evaluation of margin and sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis status during breast-conserving surgery is imperative in minimizing the likelihood of requiring additional surgical procedures. Near-infrared optical molecular imaging technology has been extensively utilized in the realm of surgical navigation, representing a significant advancement in the field of surgical oncology. However, due to safety and other concerns, very few effective probes can be applied to clinical trials, hindering the clinical implementation of fluorescence imaging. In this study, a novel technology was developed to rapidly identify tumor areas in vivo and ex vivo during surgical procedures, and delineate tumor boundaries and SLN metastases to assist surgeons in intraoperative decision-making. Methods: For animal studies, an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model, a spontaneous breast cancer transgenic mouse model, and a SLN metastasis mouse model of breast cancer were established. The tumor tissues and SLNs of mouse models above were surgically removed and incubated with a probe of different concentrations for different incubation time, then imaged by a second near-infrared window fluorescence imaging system. For clinical samples, surgically removed breast tissues and SLNs from 13 breast cancer patients were incubated with the targeting probe immediately after intraoperative resection and imaged to identify the tumor area and distinguish the tumor boundary and metastatic SLNs. The accuracy of fluorescence imaging was validated through pathological examination. Results: The ex vivo animal imaging experiments showed a fluorescence enhancement of tumor tissue and metastatic SLNs. For clinical samples, our results showed that this new technology yielded more than 90 % sensitivity and specificity in identifying the tumor area in the resected breast tissue. The average fluorescence tumor-to-normal ratios were more than three in different incubation conditions. Furthermore, we also used this technique to image metastatic SLNs intra-operatively and showed that metastatic SLNs exhibited a nearly 3-fold increase in fluorescence signal compared to benign SLNs. Calculations on the results of the fluorescence signal in relation to the metastatic status of SLNs yielded values of more than 90 % for sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: The utilization of fluorescently labeled ADC that specifically targets tumor surface proteins combined with intraoperative fluorescence imaging has effectively delineated boundaries in breast cancer specimens and facilitated the detection of metastatic SLNs. This approach has the potential to inform decisions regarding optimal resection strategies in oncology, particularly within the constraints of a limited surgical window.Citation Format:Wei-ling Chen, Yuan-yuan Zhu, Zhao Wu, Jun-hong Chen, Ting-wen Guo, Li-xin Zhang, Guo-jun Zhang.

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade therapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has shown remarkable clinical impact in multiple cancer types. However, despite its recent success, such impact has been shown to be limited to tumors encompassing specific tumor microenvironment characteristics. Furthermore, a significant proportion of initial responders eventually develop resistance. Combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy have been suggested to overcome resistance, yet have been shown to be insufficient in fully accounting for resistance. Unlike normal, differentiated cells, most cancer cells produce large amounts of lactic acid. This metabolic property is often referred to as \u201caerobic glycolysis, \u201d a well-known metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells to sustain cell proliferation and a hallmark of cancer. Such property as well as others of the altered metabolism of cancer cells and its byproducts affect the anti-tumor immune response. Notably, glycolytic metabolites, such as lactate, regulate T cell proliferation and function. However, the mechanism behind how such metabolic alterations impact the cancer cells\u2019 resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy remains unclear. Thus, we sought to decipher the role of tumor-cell derived lactic acid in PD-1/PD-L1 therapy resistance and propose new immunotherapeutic strategies to improve the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies. Here, we found that tumor cell-derived lactic acid renders the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade-resistant tumors by inhibiting the interaction between the PD-L1 protein and anti-PD-L1 antibody. Furthermore, we showed that the combination therapy of targeting PD-L1 with our PD-L1 antibody-drug conjugate (PD-L1-ADC) and reducing lactic acid with the MCT-1 inhibitor, AZD3965, can effectively treat the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade resistant tumors. Altogether, the findings in this study uncover a new mechanism of how lactic acid induces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and suggest a potential combination treatment strategy to overcome the tumor resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy and improve clinical outcomes.Citation Format:Alyssa Kim, Wonkyung Oh, Deepika Dhawan, Deborah W.

    "abstract": "Background:CDH17 is a member of the cadherin superfamily, a group of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules critical for organ development, tissue integrity, and cancer progression. In normal tissues, CDH17 is highly restricted to the lateral membrane and hidden within intestinal tight junctions which is inaccessible. In contrast, it is overexpressed and redistributed in 50% to 90% of gastrointestinal cancers, leading to its exposure on the cancer cell surface, therefore becoming more accessible. This unique feature makes CDH17 a promising target for antibody-based therapies. Here, we describe the preclinical development of LBL-054, a novel CDH17-targeting antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that is developed from a humanized CDH17 IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated with our proprietary linker-payload platform.Methods:LBL-054 targeting CDH17 monoclonal antibody was generated using mouse hybridoma technology. The binding affinity of mAb to CDH17 was determined using Fortebio and flow cytometry. The mAb internalization was assessed with anti-Fc-MMAE method. The internalization of both the mAb itself and LBL-054 was assessed by FACS method. Binding of LBL-054 to CDH17 was confirmed in human cancer cell lines and cells engineered to overexpress CDH17. Furthermore, plasma stability of LBL-054 was assessed with LC-MS methods. The killing activity of cancer cells was evaluated on CDH17 positive, negative and the mixed cancer cells. Finally, the anti-tumor effects of LBL-054 were evaluated in xenograft mouse tumor models with pharmacokinetics studies.Results:LBL-054 exhibited proper affinity, and rapid internalization. In the killing assays with CDH17 positive cancer cells LBL-054 was more potent than LBL-054-Dxd conjugate while LBL-054 was less prone than LBL-054-Dxd conjugate to kill CDH17 negative cells. And also, LBL-054 exhibited stronger bystander effect than LBL-054-Dxd conjugate. LBL-054 was highly stable in plasma stability test. A single dose of LBL-054, which induced tumor regression, was more potent than LBL-054-Dxd conjugate in the xenograft models, and better PK than LBL-054-Dxd conjugate as well.Conclusions:By conjugating with high potent/bystander/non-pgp substrate TOP1i payload exatecan with a cleavable/hydrophilic linker, LBL-054 targeting CDH17 demonstrates high stability in plasma, robust anti-tumor activity and good tolerability in the xenograft models, supporting clinical development of LBL-054 for patients with CDH17-expressing tumors.Citation Format:Yang Ye, Yurong Qin, Xingxing Fang, Xiaoya Liu, Wanting Wang, Tingting Li, Chengze Ni, Chao Chu, Mi Ye, Guojin Wu, Jianming Sun, Yue Zhao, Xiao Huang, Jordan Zhu, Shoupeng Lai, Xiaoqiang Kang, Hong Ling.

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating EGFR mutations, such as exon 19 deletions (del746-750) and the L858R point mutation in exon 21, respond well to third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like osimertinib. However, resistance inevitably emerges, limiting the long-term efficacy of these therapies. In this study, we investigated non-genomic mechanisms contributing to TKI resistance, focusing on the activation of bypass pathways that facilitate drug tolerance. These pathways enable drug tolerant persister cells to survive EGFR inhibition by exploiting alternative signaling routes. Among these, the upregulation of HER3 has been identified as a key mechanism. Clinical evidence has demonstrated the therapeutic potential of targeting HER3, notably with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) like patritumab deruxtecan. However, the precise molecular and cellular basis for HER3 dependency in NSCLC patients who progress on TKI therapy remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we employed a combination of immortalized and patient-derived cell lines, alongside advanced single-cell sequencing technologies, to elucidate the underlying biology. Our findings reveal that HER3 dependency post-TKI treatment is specifically enriched in pulmonary alveolar type I and II cells. This dependency is driven and maintained by paracrine signaling involving secreted factors, with neuregulin-1 (NRG1) playing a central role. NRG1 is primarily secreted by the tumor stroma and by cancer cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or dedifferentiation. Prolonged drug exposure further amplifies NRG1 secretion, which not only sustains HER3 activation but also promotes genetic and phenotypic plasticity. This is accompanied by EMT-associated morphological changes that enhance invasiveness and metastatic potential. Notably, our preclinical models demonstrated that the combination of an NRG1-neutralizing antibody with a dual EGFR blockade\u2014achieved through a TKI and an anti-EGFR antibody\u2014completely eradicated tumors in vivo. These results highlight the critical role of HER3 signaling and its interplay with the tumor microenvironment in mediating TKI resistance and suggest a compelling therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance in NSCLC.Citation Format:Alessandra Morselli, Donatella Romaniello, Chiara Miroglio, Martina Mazzeschi, Michela Sgarzi, Federica Pagano, Cinzia Girone, Francesca Ambrosi, William Kothalawala, Gyorffy Bal\u00e1zs, Andrea De Giglio, Michelangelo Fiorentino, Andrea Ardizzoni, Yosef Yarden, Mattia Lauriola.

    "abstract": "T cell engager (TCE) therapies targeting specific tumor associated antigens (TAAs) have shown clinical efficacy in multiple types of solid tumors. Indeed, TCE has been approved to treat melanoma and small cell lung cancer. Nevertheless, it remains necessary and challenging to improve the efficacy and safety profile of TCE to deliver benefits to more cancer patients. Recurrent and chemotherapy resistant ovarian cancer remains an urgent global unmet medical need. These is limited therapeutic options for this highly lethal and refractory disease. Recently, a MUC16 TCE demonstrated promising and durable clinical efficacy against heavily pretreated MUC16-high ovarian cancer, with acceptable safety profile. This underlines the potential to develop a MUC16 TCE with favorable safety profile and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy to possibly expand the benefits to MUC16-medium and MUC16-low ovarian cancer patients. MUC16 is a glycoprotein overexpressed in several types of solid tumors, especially in the majority of ovarian cancer. Here, we developed a 2+1 format MUC16 TCE, with improved tumor cell binding affinity, enhanced tumor cell killing potency, and MUC16-dependent T cell binding and activation. This MUC16 TCE targets membrane-proximal domains of MUC16 and achieves avidity-driven tumor cell binding in the presence of soluble CA125. Moreover, this MUC16 TCE elicited limited T cell binding and activation in the absence of MUC16, compared to benchmark molecule, to minimize off-target activity. This 2+1 format MUC16 TCE also showed favorable pharmacokinetics profile in mice. Functionally, systemic administration of this MUC16 TCE showed superior anti-tumor efficacy, with undetectable toxicity, in xenograft tumor models. Importantly, this MUC16 TCE demonstrated potent and synergistic anti-tumor efficacy in combination with clinically validated therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer in pre-clinical tumor models. This provides rationale to develop combination therapies in future clinical trials. Indeed, combination of TCE with other therapies, e.g. ADC, chemotherapy, PD1/PDL1 mAb, are being tested clinically. Together, our pre-clinical data demonstrated that a 2+1 MUC16 TCE elicits potent anti-tumor efficacy and minimized off-target T cell activation, with potential to deliver benefits to ovarian cancer patients and patient with other MUC16-positive cancer.Citation Format:Jinyang Li, Yang Li, Nan Gao, Yi Wang, Mengqiang Di, Min Wu, Yiyi Li, Ran Xue, Shiyu Hao, Weiwei Wu, Xiguang Zhang, Li Li, Shuaixiang Zhou, Huizhong Xiong.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Antibodies and ADCs are mainstays in the treatment of cancer. However, given difficulties in achieving a deep and sustained response, significant improvements are desirable. We report on first in class \u201cBooster\u201d molecules, based on clinically validated ADCC-competent antibodies, equipped with two immunomodulatory domains that are affinity engineered to be functional only when in contact with a tumor cell. We see strong expansion and increased cytotoxicity of immune cells in the presence of cancer cells in vitro, activation of relevant immune cell types ex vivo, and reduction of tumor burden in vivo, with significantly better activity than adoptive cell therapy or control antibody without fusion domains.Methods:NRG mice were engrafted with luciferase expressing SKOV3 cells via intraperitoneal injection 7 days prior to treatment. Mice received 1 million NK cells isolated from healthy donors. Compounds were administered biweekly, and low dose IL2 thrice weekly. Blood was collected weekly, and tumor burden monitored weekly via bioluminescence. ex vivo: in situ activation of tumor infiltrating immune populations was evaluated by nanostring in freshly isolated tumor tissue. in vitro: cytotoxicity was measured by quantifying the number of alive tumor cells using automated microscopy. Expansion was performed by stimulating NK cells weekly with tumor cells that were opsonized with Booster or antibody, NK cells were counted weekly to determine expansion.Results:Mice treated with a HER2 targeting Booster demonstrated superior tumor control than trastuzumab treated mice, with near tumor remission by day 35. High NK counts were observed in the blood of Booster treated mice, and no NK cells were detected in that of trastuzumab treated mice. In the peritoneal cavity, NK counts were up to 600x higher in Booster treated mice than in trastuzumab treated mice. Our Booster reprograms the immune microenvironment ex vivo in freshly isolated tumor tissue, transforming a cold tumor into a hot tumor. It activates multiple cytotoxic and IFN-\u03b3 pathways, stimulates CD8+ T cell activation, downregulates pro-tumor pathways in Tregs and induces a phenotypic shift in macrophages from the immunosuppressive M2 to the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. In separate in vitro assays we saw sustained expansion and enhanced cytotoxicity of NK cells for at least 6 weeks. Cells stimulated with HER2 Booster showed prolonged tumor control, whereas trastuzumab stimulated cells failed to sustain tumor control beyond 21 days.Conclusion:In correlation with extensive in vitro and ex vivo data, we observe a prolonged and significant improvement in tumor control in mice treated with Boosters compared to mice treated with trastuzumab. Work is ongoing to develop these molecules, with the first clinical trial expected to start in 2026.Citation Format:Sophie Poznanski, Erik Slinger, Jarek Juraszek, Fatemeh Vahedi, Marcelo Pereira, Loreto Parga-Vidal, Dean Lee, Ali Ashkar, Robert Friesen.

    "abstract": "Background:Peritoneal metastasis is the result of direct shedding of tumor cells from ovarian, colorectal, and other cancers that lead to studding and growth on the peritoneal surfaces and abdominal organs. Standard chemotherapy and surgery can transiently improve symptoms, but long-term disease control and survival extension remain rare due to residual disease and treatment resistance. In the past 40 years, tremendous progress in photoimmunotherapy (PIT) has been made to treat metastasis. However, many are lost in translation due to heterogeneity in photosensitizer drug uptake and treatment response. Thus, we hypothesize that the delivery of targeted therapies with a multimodal approach for PIT and integrates well with current standards of care strategies can help overcome heterogeneous delivery and improved treatment efficacy. Our novel targeted photoactivable multi-agent liposome (TPMAL) combined with fluorescence-guided PIT was demonstrated in this newly reported study.Methods:TPMAL consists of antibody drug conjugates (photosensitizer drug and anti-EGFR antibody) conjugated onto active-loaded liposomal surface. Female athymic nude mice (18-20 g and 4-6 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 3 x 107 OVCAR-5 human ovarian cancer cells suspended in 2 mL of PBS. Post tumor implantation, mice were i.p. injected with TPMAL or ADC alone on Day 10. Post 24h, tumor nodules were collected and frozen with Tissue-Tek O.C.T compound at -80\u00b0C until slicing. Fluorescence and bright field imaging of whole tumor nodule slices were performed with a Lionheart\u2122 FX Automated Microscope. The center of each tumor nodule was selected for further image analysis using ImageJ. Lastly, intraperitoneal fluorescence-guided light delivery PIT with TPMAL was performed using the ML7710 medial laser device and Modulight cloud software for survival studies.Results:TPMAL active-loaded formulation demonstrated batch-to-batch consistency and stability was observed for up to one year. This formulation also demonstrated enhanced photosensitizer drug delivery into peritoneal tumor nodules by 1.6X and up to 616.4 \u03bcm penetration depth compared to antibody drug conjugates alone. TPMAL FGLD PIT combination therapy with adjuvant chemotherapy also demonstrated enhanced long-term survival by 240X compared to no treatment and chemotherapy alone groups.Conclusions:Our novel targeted photoactivable multi-agent liposome (TPMAL) combined with fluorescence-guided PIT was investigated for its translational potential and therapeutic efficacy by (1) developing an active-loaded liposomal formulation, (2) studying tumor nodule penetration depth of TPMAL, (3) understanding tissue optical property via oxygenation and how it may affect PIT using the ML7710, and (4) enhancing long term therapeutic efficacy compared to monotherapy treated groups in a mouse peritoneal carcinomatosis model.Citation Format:Sumiao Pang, Carla Arnau Del Valle, Robert Perttila, Nada Fadul, Dana Roque, Tayyaba Hasan, Petteri Uusimaa, Huang Chiao` Huang.

    "abstract": "Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody attached to DXd, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, via a plasma stable cleavable linker. Dato-DXd is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of patients with solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hormone receptor positive and triple negative breast cancer. Recently, TROP2 Normalized Membrane Ratio (NMR) was identified as an exploratory predictive biomarker for Dato-DXd, in patients with non-squamous (NSQ), non-actionable genomically altered (AGA) NSCLC in the phase 3 TROPION-Lung01 study. TROP2 NMR is a quantitative scoring algorithm that measures membrane TROP2 expression relative to the combined sum of cytoplasmic and membrane TROP2 expression for every tumor cell in a TROP2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained tissue sample. Herein, we further describe the role of TROP2 in the mechanism of action (MoA) for Dato-DXd and the biological rationale linking TROP2 NMR to its pharmacological mode of action. Utilizing an isogenic cell line series in NCI-H322, a NSQ, non-AGA NSCLC cell line, where TROP2 was either knocked-out (KO) or over-expressed, we demonstrate that Dato-DXd binding and efficacy is dependent on TROP2 expression. TROP2-KO resulted in complete loss of Dato-DXd binding, delivery of intracellular DXd, in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy of Dato-DXd implicating the MoA of Dato-DXd requires TROP2. However, TROP2 expression was not sufficient to predict Dato-DXd activity in a broad panel of cell lines across multiple indications including NSCLC. In 34 NSCLC cell lines, TROP2 mRNA expression generally correlated with Dato-DXd activity, however, among the TROP2-high NSCLC cell lines (n=17), there was a mixture of Dato-DXd sensitive and insensitive cell lines. As internalization of the Dato-DXd-bound TROP2 complex is central to its MoA, we measured the internalization capacity of Dato-DXd in NSCLC cell lines (n=15). Dato-DXd internalization required binding to cells, however, there was a differential capacity for Dato-DXd internalization across cell lines despite similar levels of Dato-DXd binding. Importantly, characterization of the TROP2 IHC staining pattern revealed a strong correlation between TROP2 NMR, but not membrane nor cytoplasmic TROP2, and Dato-DXd internalization capacity and efficacy across these NSCLC cell lines. This suggests TROP2 NMR can predict the innate internalization capacity of Dato-DXd from TROP2 IHC stained samples. Collectively, these data highlight the key role TROP2 plays in the MoA of Dato-DXd in preclinical NSCLC models and provides the molecular basis underpinning the biological rationale for TROP2 NMR as an innovative biomarker for Dato-DXd activity in NSCLC.Citation Format:Matthew S.

    "abstract": "Systemic peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) humanized model is a straightforward tool to evaluate therapeutic immuno-oncology (IO) drugs, including immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) and bispecific antibodies (BsAb). However, the model has a limited dosing regimen window due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as seen in most immune deficient recipients. There is also a relative lower responsible rate from insufficient antigen specific immune cells infiltration into tumor microenvironment (TME). Thus, application of this PBMC humanized model is restricted in evaluation of multiple ICBs and myeloid cell- or lymphocyte-mediated BsAbs. To overcome this, LIDE has developed a unique co-inoculation model with primed human PBMC (or/and its derived immune cell subsets) and cancer cells. Cancer-priming human PBMCs are well mixed with fresh cancer cells in MatriGel, co-inoculated into immune deficient mice to form an immune cell relatively warm tumor tissue for late immunotherapy. This model can significantly delay the graft-versus-host-reaction for another month compared with traditional systemic PBMC humanized model, and achieves maximal therapeutic effect of the testing drugs by pre-activating T cells with specific tumor antigens. Considering minimum innate immune cells in TME, dendritic cells or macrophages are expanded ex vivo, then transferred into this co-inoculated system to work together with T cells with a proper survival rate in the dosing period, mimic clinical biopsy complexity, to help determine the overall effect induced by integrated signals. It seems CD40 agonist or CD47 antagonist could well synergize with anti-PD(L)1 to control melanoma and triple negative breast cancer development, respectively. This optimized immune cell humanized cancer-bearing mice models have been tested for various cancer targets, e.g., PD(L)1, Tim3, Lag3, Tigit, PVRIG, TGF\u03b21, CD73/CD39, CD47/Sirpa, DLL3/CD3, Claudin18.2/4-1BB/CD3, B7H3/CD3/ADC, GPC3/CD3, GPRC5D/CD3, CSF1R, GITR, (Pro)IL2/IL15, to better understand the interaction and modulation between cancer cells and immune cells.Citation Format:Bin Xie,Xin Hou,Pengfei Yang,Yanbing Zhou,Loc Van,Diandong Jiang,Josh Caggiula,Danyi Wen.

    "abstract": "Introduction-TROP2, a transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the TACSTD2 gene, is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer (PC) and contributes to cancer progression. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting TROP2, utilizing a novel linker technology that is only cleaved following internalization. It has demonstrated clinical activity in breast and lung cancers and is under investigation in PC. Determinants of response and resistance to ADCs are not well studied. Here, we investigate predictors of Dato-DXd efficacy in PDAC using in vitro models. Method-Twenty six PC cell lines with varying TROP2 mRNA levels were tested using Dato-DXd, isotype control-DXd, and naked toxin DXd in 96-well plates using CellTiter-Glo\u00ae. Drug sensitivity was correlated with mechanism based predictors using Pearson\u2019s correlation. Cell surface TROP2 was quantified using QIFIKIT; antibody internalization was analyzed using iQue\u00ae Human Antibody Internalization Reagent and quantified with Quantum\u2122 MESF microsphere kit. Cathepsin B activity was measured with the Magic Red\u00ae Fluorescent Cathepsin B Assay Kit.Result-To identify factors influencing response and resistance, we used the ratio of AUC (Area Under the Curve) of Dato-DXd to AUC of Isotype-DXd (AUC Dato/Isotype) as a standardized measure of efficacy. AUC Dato/Isotype approaching 1 indicate no activity of Dato-DXd over isotype control, and lower values signify selective cytotoxicity mediated by Dato-DXd. We noted no activity of Dato-DXd in cell lines lacking surface expression of TROP2 (n = 4), whereas responses varied among TROP2+ lines. To explore predictors of Dato-DXd response in TROP2+ cell lines (n = 22), we examined the relationship of TROP2 mRNA levels, TROP2 surface expression, Dato-DXd internalization, and Cathepsin B activity with Dato-DXd sensitivity, using Pearson correlation. AUC of the DXd (payload) is highly correlated with the Dato-DXd sensitivity (r = 0.63, p = 0.002). Further review of sensitivity of to DXd showed natural separation of tested models into DXd sensitive and resistant models at 1nM DXd concentration. Lines resistant to DXd at 1 nM showed significantly higher resistance to Dato-DXd (two-tailed t-test, t = 7.34, p < 0.0001). Conclusion-PC in vitro models reveal a range of sensitivities to Dato-DXd. We found that TROP2 expression is necessary but not sufficient for sensitivity to Dato-DXd and intrinsic resistance to payload is highly correlated with resistance to Dato-DXd. Ongoing analyses to identify additional predictors of response to Dato-DXd using whole transcriptome profiles of tested models will be presented.Citation Format:Panot Sainamthip, Kazuki Takahashi, Jiajia Chen, Junning Wang, Julien Dilly, Seema Chugh, David Lui, Andrew J.

    "abstract": "Heterobifunctional small molecules recruiting the proteasomal machinery enable the targeted protein degradation (TPD) of selected proteins and considerably broaden the druggable space for therapeutic use. Many such molecules have seen fantastic success in preclinical and clinical developments, e.g., for targeted degradation of specific oncoproteins that were previously inaccessible for cancer therapy. Even though early hits are quickly generated by adapting the modular concept of bifunctional degraders, most of such molecules are against the central rules of a \u201cdrug-like\u201d molecule: they are usually larger in size (800-1500 Da) and often lack sufficient solubility. These early bifunctional degraders hits require exhaustive structure optimization in each case to optimize pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles and bioavailability.Here, we report Tubulis\u2019 antibody-degrader conjugates that exploit bifunctional degraders as high-potency bioactive payloads to be released specifically inside cells that are targeted by the antibody. Our linker technology ensures high degrader-to-antibody ratios (DARs) and excellent linker stability in blood plasma. Moreover, we liberate the degrader after receptor-mediated uptake of the ADC and show high efficiencies in target protein degradation. Most importantly, our conjugates exhibit antibody-like PK properties that ensure long-lasting plasma circulation of high DAR constructs over weeks, even when bifunctional degraders are employed that have not been optimized for PK properties. Taken together, these factors allow impressive in vivo efficacy of the conjugates after single dose application in preclinical animal models.Citation Format:Jan G. Felber, Anil P.

    "abstract": "HER2 genetic aberrations are found across various cancer types. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), an anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), has been approved for the treatment of HER2-amplified breast and gastric cancers, HER2-mutant lung cancer, and HER2-overexpressing solid tumors. The approval of T-DXd has recently been expanded to include patients with HER2-low breast cancer. In addition, a clinical trial in lung cancer has demonstrated that the efficacy of T-DXd is not correlated with HER2 expression or specific genetic mutations. These findings suggest the presence of factors beyond HER2 expression that affect T-DXd sensitivity. To identify novel determinants of T-DXd efficacy in HER2-positive cancers, we first evaluated its anti-tumor activity in in vitro and in vivo using patient-derived HER2-positive lung cancer cell lines, JFCR-007 and JFCR-381. Interestingly, these cells showed significant shrinkage only by a single dose of T-DXd when implanted in BALB/c-nu mice, they were resistant to T-DXd in a regular 2D culture condition. Therefore, we hypothesized that tumor microenvironment affected T-DXd sensitivity. Cancer cells in patient tumor tissue are surrounded by non-cancerous cells, so we used a three-dimensional (3D) layered co-culture model with fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM). We developed a 3D-in model, in which cancer cells are mixed with fibroblasts and ECM. We also made 3D-on, in which cancer cells were layered on the top of approximately 30 layers of fibroblasts, and 3D-out, in which cancer cells were seeded outside the chamber insert filled with 30 layers fibroblasts. Strikingly, the two lung cancer cell lines became sensitive to T-DXd in the 3D-in and the 3D-on state compared to the 3D-out model. Next, this co-culture model was applied to the HER2-low breast cancer, for which T-DXd has been shown to significantly prolong progression-free survival (PFS) in more than half of cases. We therefore established HER2-knockout and -low expressing breast cancer cell lines (HCC1954 and MDA-MB-453) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system followed by sorting with cell sorter. These HER2-low and -null cells were resistant to T-DXd in 2D culture state compared to parental cells. However, they became sensitive to T-DXd when cultured in 3D-in and 3D-on state. To identify the mechanism by which cancer cells become T-DXd-sensitive in 3D co-culture systems, we focused on cathepsins, lysosomal peptidases that cleave the T-DXd linker. The cathepsin subtypes capable of cleaving the amino acid sequence in the T-DXd linker were knocked down and examined the T-DXd sensitivity. Notably, cancer cells exhibited resistance to T-DXd when some cathepsin subtypes were individually knocked down. Collectively, our results suggest that certain types of cathepsins in the tumor microenvironment may play a critical role in the anti-tumor effects of T-DXd.Citation Format:Akari Shiraishi, Asumi Iesato, Yuki Takahashi, Ken Uchibori, Tomo Osako, Reo Maruyama, Makoto Nishio, Ryohei Katayama.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Many approvals of advanced drugs, such as Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) or immunotherapies, have not provided significant treatment benefits for patients with metastatic gastric cancer (GC). There remains an urgent need to develop novel therapies. However, the lack of well-defined oncogene targets has hindered progress in therapy development. A patient-like disease model was established using patient samples and a 3D co-culture platform, the Microphysiological System (MPS). Patient cells in this model preserved key properties and successfully replicated clinical phenotypes in the model. Promising therapeutic targets were identified through chemogenomic screening. To address resistance to single-target inhibition, potential combination targets were predicted using AI tools enhanced with target-based knowledge graphs (KG) and active learning algorithms. The top 20 combination targets were selected and tested, resulting in promising combination hits that demonstrated significant efficacy for this challenging and heterogeneous disease. The integration of AI-assisted combination discovery with the patient-like disease model has uncovered new opportunities for developing novel therapies and combination treatments.Methods:For the vascularized GC model, patient cells, isolated from surgical specimens or ascitic fluid, were expanded and formed into spheroids. These spheroids were co-cultured with Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) in Curiochips by embedding them in a hydrogel. The chemogenomic library was developed based on pathway analyses of RNAseq and proteomics studies of advanced gastric cancer. Additionally, the combination library was designed by the process utilized AI for image feature extraction, supplemented by a target-based knowledge graph (KG) that integrated data from over 20 public databases, encompassing genomics, proteomics, drug interactions, and pathway information. All screens were performed using high-throughput screening (HTS) instruments, including high-content confocal microscopy, leveraging the HTS compatibility of Curiochips.Results:Metastatic GC patient samples exhibited clinical phenotypes of aggressive migration and angiogenesis when co-cultured with endothelial cells in 3D. From pathway analysis, 200 targets were identified, and their inhibitors were screened in the vascularized model. The top targets were prioritized based on image analysis of GC phenotypic landscape. Among these, PKMYT1 was selected as a test case for identifying potential combination targets. Using the target-based KG, 20 top targets for combination with the PKMYT1 inhibitor were identified and screened in the disease model. The combination demonstrated promising efficacy and significantly delayed the onset of drug resistance.Citation Format:Yeongmin Choi, Sumin Kim, Yangji Kim, Youngsook Song, Jinhwan Jang, Delaney Donnelly, Bushra Rajput, Tsung-Li Liu, Kyusuk Baek, Aneesh Sathe, Sanghee Yoo.

    "abstract": "Background:Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer subtype and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Advances in treatment have focused on personalized approaches that use targeted therapies and immunotherapies based on protein, DNA, or RNA biomarkers. Assessing molecular biomarkers typically takes 1-2 weeks with challenges such as tissue exhaustion and poor response prediction. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows for point-of care evaluation of nanomechanical signatures (NS) in hours, offering a fast and accurate method for diagnosis and treatment personalization.Methods:We used the AFM-based Automated and Reliable Tissue Diagnostics (ARTIDIS) platform to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of NS. Fresh tumor and paired uninvolved pulmonary tissue samples were collected from 70 early-stage NSCLC patients who underwent curative surgical procedures at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. Measurements were blinded, and samples were preserved in formalin for further histopathological and molecular analyses.Results:In this proof-of-concept study, ARTIDIS NS successfully distinguished malignant tumors from uninvolved pulmonary tissue with 88% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 87% accuracy (n=52). The NS also accurately identified histological subtypes, including adenocarcinoma (ADC, 100% sensitivity) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, 83% specificity). ARTIDIS NS identified aggressive features predictive of early recurrence in non-involved samples (82% sensitivity, 72% specificity). Out of 70 patients, 17 had recurrences (median time: 7.7 months), leading to 12 deaths, 10 due to cancer. Remarkably, ARTIDIS NS accurately predicted tumor progression within 10 months post-surgery, achieving 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity in identifying patients at risk of recurrence after curative treatment.Conclusions:The findings suggest that ARTIDIS NS is a rapid and reliable tool for predicting recurrence and assessing outcomes in NSCLC while preserving tissues for downstream assessment. The ARTIDIS platform not only demonstrated significant accuracy in differentiating malignant tissues, but also showed exceptional precision in predicting early recurrence and progression, effectively identifying high-risk patients. Furthermore, NS identified early recurrence indicators through nanomechanical changes in uninvolved samples, offering insights beyond traditional pathology. A 200-patient extension specifically in neoadjuvant treatment is planned to enhance NSCLC management and improve patient outcomes.Citation Format:Jordi Alcaraz, Elba Marin, Hector Sanz-Fraile, Marina Querol, Paula Gausa, Kate Neal, Marselina Arshakyan, Marc Rico-Past\u00f3, Marc Boada, David Sanchez, Daniel Martinez, Reinier Oropesa Nunez, Gitika Srivastava, Ahmed Jizawi, Carolina Ortiz-Velez, Tobias Appenzeller, Sara Nizzero, Marko Loparic, Marija Plodinec, Noemi Reguart.

    "abstract": "Background:Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Targeted therapies offer a promising approach to improve treatment efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity. Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in multiple cancers including lung cancer. Trop-2 is an ideal candidate for targeted therapy of NSCLC as it is highly expressed in NSCLC in comparison to normal cells and it is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain that can be targeted by therapies. Recently various Trop-2-targeted therapies have been investigated in clinical trials, including anti-Trop-2 antibodies and Trop-2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). This study aims to discover a Trop-2 specific peptide using phage display biopanning and develop a liposomal formulation surface-modified with the identified peptide for targeted chemo-immunotherapy.Methods:A peptide phage display library was screened to identify peptides with high affinity for Trop-2 protein. The selected Trop-2 peptide was conjugated to the surface of liposomes encapsulating cisplatin and anti-PDL1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv). The targeting efficiency, cytotoxicity, and immunomodulatory effects of the Trop-2 peptide-modified liposomes were evaluated in vitro using A549 lung cancer cell lines and in vivo in Calu-3 NSCLC xenograft model.Results:The phage display biopanning successfully identified a high-affinity Trop-2 peptide. Liposomes modified with this peptide demonstrated enhanced binding and uptake by A549 lung cancer cells compared to non-targeted liposomes. In vivo, the targeted liposomal formulation exhibited superior tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival in the Calu-3 NSCLC xenograft model.Conclusion:The discovery of a Trop-2 specific peptide via phage display and its application in targeted liposomal delivery of cisplatin and anti-PDL1 scFv represents a novel and effective strategy for lung cancer chemo-immunotherapy. This approach holds potential for improving therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects in lung cancer patients.Citation Format:Bahaa S.

    "abstract": "Introduction:CD26 is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in many cancers. We established the humanized anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody YS110, which has a direct anti-tumor effect through nuclear translocation of CD26 and transcriptional suppression of the POLR2A gene, a subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Subsequently, we developed an antibody-drug conjugate Y-TR-1 with YS110 and the Pol II inhibitor triptolide and evaluated its in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy and toxicity. We then elucidated the mechanism of action of Y-TR-1.Experimental procedures:5 triptolide molecules on average were crosslinked to YS110 by the heterobifunctional linker SMCC (designated Y-TR-1). The in vitro cytotoxicity of Y-TR-1 was analyzed in CD26-positive or -negative cancer cells and normal cells. The in vivo antitumor effect of Y-TR-1 was assessed using a xenograft assay. Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies and toxicity tests were conducted using cynomolgus monkeys. Western blotting and immunofluorescence imaging were performed to confirm the nuclear translocation of Y-TR-1. The inhibitory effect of Y-TR-1 against Pol II was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and a live cell imaging assay. The molecular mechanism of Y-TR-1 nuclear translocation was elucidated by immunofluorescence imaging.Results:A conjugation method of Y-TR-1 was established, and the average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) was 4.76 by LC/MS. Y-TR-1 showed in vitro cytotoxicity on CD26-positive cancer cells, whereas non-cancer cells were less susceptible to Y-TR-1. The in vivo antitumor effect of Y-TR-1 was confirmed in a xenograft study using three CD26-positive cancer cell lines. Toxicity studies of cynomolgus monkeys with cross-reactivity to Y-TR-1 revealed no severe toxicity. The animals that received 30 mg/kg body weight of Y-TR-1 showed some decline in the reticulocyte count and slight increase in the thrombocyte count, whereas no histological damage was observed in the liver, kidney, heart, or lungs. Nuclear translocated Y-TR-1 was confirmed in the nuclear fraction of CD26-positive cancer cells by western blotting or immunofluorescence imaging. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and live cell imaging assays revealed Pol II inhibition by Y-TR-1. Y-TR-1 was internalized via caveolae-dependent endocytosis and subsequently colocalized with endosomes before translocation to the nucleus.Conclusions:Y-TR-1 is an ADC with a novel mechanism of action, i.e., nuclear translocation and subsequent Pol II inhibition. Transcriptional repression of POLR2A expression by nuclear-localized CD26 and Pol II inhibition by internalized triptolide are expected to have additive effects. Y-TR1 exhibited potent antitumor activity against CD26-positive cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.Citation Format:Mutsumi Hayashi, Hiroko Madokoro, Koji Yamada, Ryo Hatano, Chikao Morimoto, Taketo Yamada.

    "abstract": "The ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related (ATR) kinase is a crucial component of the DNA damage response (DDR) and functions in conjunction with ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Loss or functional deficiency of ATM may lead to increased reliance on ATR signaling pathways. Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated a potential synthetic lethality between ATR inhibition and ATM deficiency. We have identified a novel, potent, and highly selective ATR inhibitor IMP9064. Herein we present its discovery and IND enabling in vitro and in vivo studies. IMP9064 is highly activity inhibiting ATR, and is highly selective among kinases. IMP9064 also shows potent cytotoxicity to a wide range of cancer cell lines. In addition, IMP9064 has a desirable PK profile in preclinical species. IMP9064 has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in human colorectal cancer CDX animal models with good dose-response tumor growth inhibition and tolerability. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that used alone or in combination with PARP inhibitor, WEE1 inhibitor, PKMYT1 inhibitor or HER2 ADC, IMP9064 has good anti-tumor activity and synergistic effect. IMP9064 has entered a phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy either as monotherapy or in combination with PARP inhibitor Senaparib in patients with advanced solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05269316). The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined and IMP9064 is currently in expansion studies for selected tumors.Citation Format:Sui Xiong Cai, Ning Ma, Xiaozhu Wang, Yangzhen Jiang, Mingchuan Guo, Ruiyu Zhou, Mu Chen, Ye Edward Tian.

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is becoming a promising cancer treatment for microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H) pan-cancers, and combination therapy with IO drugs and anti-angiogenesis or antibody-drug-conjugates is considered as a first-line therapy for advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer respectively. Though human CD34+HSC and PBMC humanized models are valuable tools to investigate the in vivo function and mechanism of immuno-oncology drugs, the allogeneic reaction between targeted cancer tissue and human immune system is a serious issue. Obviously, this could interfere with the fundamental reaction of the testing drugs particularly with mismatched HLA donors. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet need for a preclinical in vivo model that effectively mimics patients through autologous immune systems. LIDE\u2019s Mini-PDX (mini-patient-derived xenografts) model has been widely applied to test the in vivo chemosensitivity of chemical and targeted compounds for more than 3000 clinical biopsies in the last decade. Leveraging this in vivo organoid system, we have developed the immuno-oncology version of MiniPDX, named \u201cImmuno-Oncology drugs Fast In Vivo Efficacy\u201d test or IO-FIVE. This assay uses patient cancer cells with its microenvironment immune cells and stroma cells isolated from the same fresh biopsy, well mixed and co-inoculated in mini-capsules before implantation into immune deficient mice. Total tissue viability and phenotyping of each cell subsets could be assessed within 2 weeks by Celltiter Glo and flow cytometry analysis respectively. Furthermore, omics study would shed new light for deeper understanding about the mechanism. Using this model, we found that Daratumumab (CD38-Ab) had a tumor suppression effect in less than half of CD38+ acute myeloid leukemia patients (response rate is around 30% in all AML N>60), and laboratory IO-FIVE data guided clinical Sintilimab (PD1-Ab), bevacizumab and capecitabine combo-therapy leads to a stable disease (SD) type for one advanced lung metastatic colon cancer patient with microsatellite stable genotype. Consistent to clinical trials, PD1 antibody (e.g., Sintilimab) monotherapy seems have limited tumor control effect in around one-fourth of ovarian cancer patients (N=11), IO and PARP inhibitor combo-therapy or novel drugs (bispecific antibody, ADCs) may enhance the immunotherapy efficiency and sensitivity. Our IO-FIVE model is offered as a unique in vivo functional assay to help do patient stratification as well as MOA studies.Citation Format:Bin Xie, Yang Liu, Yu Di, Xiaorong Gu, Kaimeng Hu, Song Xu, Loc Van, Josh Caggiula, Diandong Jiang, Danyi Wen.

    "abstract": "Due to the importance of aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) regulation in many cancers, we sought to employ the Lumit Immunoassay Cellular System (Lumit ICS) in order to characterize signaling nodes within important RTK signaling pathways. Lumit ICS is a homogenous immunoassay for detecting targets of interest in cellular lysate. Phosphorylated or total protein can be detected in as little as two hours with a simple add and read format. In this study, we generated several Lumit assays to explore whether Lumit was capable of teasing out mechanistic differences between various drug treatment modalities. These assays include p-EGFR, p-HER2, p-cMET, and various downstream nodes such as p-AKT and p-H2AX. In EGFR WT cell lines, we observed increased phosphorylation of EGFR when treating cells with the ligand, EGF. This increased phosphorylation was inhibited with both small molecule inhibitors, such as erlotinib, and monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab. However, in mutant EGFR cell lines that have a level of basal EGFR phosphorylation, only small molecule inhibitors could completely inhibit EGFR phosphorylation. Cetuximab was only capable of inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation stemming from extracellular stimulation (EGF) and not basal p-EGFR. Within the HER2 overexpressed cell line BT474, we detected a high level of basal HER2 phosphorylation. This increased phosphorylation could be inhibited by the small molecule inhibitor CP-724714. However, when treating BT474 cells with monoclonal therapies such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, we saw a robust increase in HER2 phosphorylation at early timepoints and a more modest increase at longer treatment timepoints. We also noted differences in other cell signaling nodes when treating HER2 overexpressing cells with varying treatment modalities. When treating cells with the antibody drug conjugate (ADC) DS-8201a, we noted increased HER2 phosphorylation, as well as increased phosphorylation of the DNA damage response (DDR) mark, p-H2AX. Increased p-H2AX was not seen when treating the same cell line with trastuzumab. An increase in DNA damage response with DS-8201a treatment fits within the context of DS-8201a delivering a topoisomerase inhibitor as its payload. Finally, we noted a loss of AKT phosphorylation when treating BT474 cells with trastuzumab, but not DS-8201a. While we have yet to explore the reason for this difference in AKT phosphorylation, this result highlights the divergent effects of varying treatment modalities on downstream signaling. Overall, these data exemplify the complexity of cell signaling pathway inhibition and demonstrate Lumit ICS as being an assay capable of teasing out some of that complexity.Citation Format:Matthew R.

    "abstract": "Background:Adenocarcinoma (ADCA) is a type of cancer that originates in glandular epithelial cells in various organs such as pancreas, colon and lung. Spatial transcriptomics enables the high-resolution mapping of gene expression within the tumor microenvironment, preserving spatial context. This allows for the identification of tumor-specific targets in the context of complex tumor microenvironment, providing insights critical for precision oncology. Through a data-driven target discovery platform which leverages large scale transcriptomic data including ST, a novel target, POR-ADCA-001, was identified. Here, we developed human antibodies that have superior specificity and binding affinity to POR-ADCA-001.Methods:Panning phage display, filter lift assay, and Solid Phase Extraction Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (SPE ELISA) were utilized to screen hit antibodies with strong binding potential to the target protein. Furthermore, ELISA and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis were used to identify lead candidate antibodies (POR-ADCA-001-01, POR-ADCA-001-02) that can effectively target POR-ADCA-001 at low concentrations. Moreover, a cell line overexpressing POR-ADCA-001 (cell-1) and a non-expressing cell line (cell-2) were validated using western blot and immunofluorescence. At last, we examined the effectiveness of the antibodies using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and internalization assay.Results:Spatial and differential expression analyses revealed POR-ADCA-001 as highly expressed in various ADCA tissues with low expression in normal tissues. On ELISA, 28 hits were found and the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of them were one or two digit nM. Among them, POR-ADCA-001-01, 02 were selected for further development and demonstrated the binding affinity of 0.84 and 14.8 nM. We demonstrated using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence that the two antibodies bind strongly to cell-1 but hardly bind to cell-2. Internalization assays confirmed substantial uptake of the antibodies in cell-1, with minimal activity in control cell lines.Conclusion:Our research identified POR-ADCA-001 as a target specific to pan-adenocarcinoma and discovered two human IgG antibodies that demonstrate high specificity and effective internalization in cells that express the target. These antibodies could be utilized for the development of targeted therapeutics such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) or radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs). This study emphasizes the promise of ST in uncovering new therapeutic targets and improving cancer treatment.Citation Format:MinKyu Kim, Jinyeoung Choi, Jae Eun Lee, Hongyoon Choi, Hyung-Jun Im.

    "abstract": "Background:EGFR (also known as HER1) is an epidermal growth factor receptor with tyrosine kinase activity implicated in both tumorigenesis and tumor progression, and its overexpression in approximately 70% of colorectal cancer (CRC), 60% of lung cancers, and over 90% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have been shown associated with advanced diseases. Approved anti-EGFR therapies, including cetuximab, pantitumumab, and necitumumab, are widely used in treating the aforementioned malignancies. Amivantamab, a bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and c-MET, has been approved for treating advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations. HER3, another member of the HER family, is overexpressed in cancers including CRC and lung cancer. The upregulation of HER3 has been reported in tumors when treated with MAPK/PI3K inhibitors, EGFR TKIs, or hormone therapies. Daiichi\u2019s HER3-ADC, U3-1402, has shown promising clinical results in advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, confirming HER3 as a valid therapeutic target. CS2011 is a bispecific antibody composed of a potent anti-EGFR arm and a fully functional anti-HER3 arm. Unlike anti-EGFR, anti-HER2 or anti-HER3 mono-targeting antibodies, CS2011 inhibits almost all functional membrane dimers formed with HER members, and therefore acts as a broad epithelial growth factor signaling blocker to address tumor heterogeneity effectively.Methods & Results:The lead molecule of CS2011, J17, was constructed with monovalent arms targeting EGFR and HER3. J17 showed high binding affinities to EGFR or HER3 respectively and dual binding to EGFR & HER3 concurrently, as assessed by BLI. Our data further demonstrated that J17 possessed single-digit nanomolar affinities to EGFR-positive and/or HER3-positive tumor cells, while demonstrating no binding activity to EGFR/HER3-negative cells. J17 induced faster and deeper internalization compared to anti-EGFR and anti-HER3 mono-targeting antibodies. J17 also effectively inhibited EGFR downstream signaling to levels similar to anti-EGFR antibodies. Furthermore, J17 inhibited NRG1 (HER3 ligand)-induced proliferation of A431 cells. In-vivo studies further demonstrated potent tumor growth inhibition by J17. J17 also demonstrated favorable stability and developability, achieving yields comparable to those of monoclonal antibodies. Pilot pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys suggested a monoclonal antibody-like PK profile and favorable tolerability at 30 mg/kg.Conclusion:CS2011 is a promising bispecific antibody for the treatment of various advanced solid tumors. Current preclinical data support further IND-enabling development and clinical research on CS2011.Citation Format:Chuan Wang, Ning Zhang, Xinling Zhang, Yongwang Li, Yongli Yang, Mengyao Zhu, Yuxin Qian, Jingyu Sun, Xuelian Liu, Fei Ma, Yi Sun, Jianxin Yang.

    "abstract": "SNV1521 is clinical stage PARP1 inhibitor and trapper with excellent potency and selectivity against other MARP and PARP proteins. Although several first generation non-PARP1 selective inhibitors have been approved primarily as monotherapy for BRCA-associated tumors, they have not fully realized the potential of PARP inhibition as a mechanism for potentiation of chemo-, DNA damage response, and radiation therapy because of overlapping toxicities including hematologic suppression. SNV1521 shows exquisite selectivity for PARP1 over PARP2 and other related proteins in biochemical assays compared with both first-generation PARPi and saruparib. In colony formation assays using normal donor HSPCs, SNV1521 exhibited significantly less suppression of the proliferation of both myeloid and erythroid lineages compared with these inhibitors. When comparing with the target efficacious concentration using a BRCA2-deficient cell line versus the NOEL for suppression of heme progenitors, SNV1521 showed an expanded margin versus either olaparib or saruparib. These data support the potential of SNV1521 to combine more effectively with approved and experimental oncology drugs. In cell-based combination experiments, SNV1521 strongly synergized with topoisomerase-1 inhibitors as well ADCs utilizing topo-1 based warheads. Importantly, the combination benefit extended to cell lines that were not intrinsically sensitive to PARP inhibitors suggesting activity in cell models beyond those with functional defects in homologous recombination. In a PDX model of breast cancer, the combination of topotecan with SNV1521 showed deeper tumor regression than either agent alone. Moreover, this activity showed durable anti-tumor activity after cessation of dosing. In summary, these data support the continued clinical development of SNV1521 as monotherapy and also in combination with drugs that are mechanistically synergistic but cannot be effectively combined with less selective PARP1 inhibitors because of overlapping toxicities.Citation Format:Mingming Gao, Qipeng Fan, Zhentian Li, Jun Pan, Renxu Chang, Liangxing Wu, Wenqing Yao, Phillip CC Liu.

    "abstract": "This study highlights the latest advancements of ImmuMab\u00ae gene-edited mouse platform, engineered with human immunoglobulin germlines to facilitate efficient antibody therapeutic development across diverse formats, including canonical, heavy-chain-only (HCO), common-light-chain (CLC), or combinations thereof. Utilizing massive-fragment across species in situ replacement technology, these mice underwent Mb-scale humanization of immunoglobulin gene fragments in single-step operations, circumventing the cumulative cellular damage associated with traditional transgenic approaches.These new mice all deliver distinguished immune dynamic profiles featuring rapid initial immune responses and compelling titer plateaus. Since their introductions, the ImmuMab\u00ae mouse suite (HK, HKL, HL, HCO, CLC) has consistently delivered highly diversified repertoires across 35+ antibody discovery programs, with no failures due to suboptimal immune responses.Designed for canonical antibody generation, the ImmuMab HK, HKL and HL mice (the latter two newly introduced), feature up to over 3.2 Mb human Immunoglobulin variable region genes. The ImmuMab HK mice in different project had deliver stable median titers ranging from 72.9k to 656.1k by the third dose, with some maximum titers approaching 1968.3k. Their immune responses exhibit robust resilience against challenging targets, including seven-transmembrane receptors and antigens with over 99% human-mouse homology. Notably, in one hybridoma screening against hROR1, the primary clone positivity rate (OD450 > 0.5) exceeded 33%. Selected monoclonal antibodies demonstrating affinities ranging from 0.001 to 1 nM (by BLI) and internalization rates of 20%-90% (Temperature-dependent). Some antibodies further demonstrated superior cytotoxic efficacy (MMAE-conjugated) compared to benchmark antibody-drug conjugates (ADC).Additionally, one discovery program with ImmuMab Light\u00ae (CLC) mice by rapid immunization (1-week intervals) yielded seven candidate antibodies with picomolar EC50 values (EC50 < 5 \u00d7 10-10 M, ELISA) within a single screening cycle. Furthermore, the ImmuMab Heavy\u00ae (HCO) mouse enabled rapid heavy-chain-only immune response, reaching titers of 218.7k\u223c656.1k within four weeks and identifying nanomolar heavy-chain-only antibodies with low single-digit nanomolar EC50 values for both human and cynomolgus monkey antigens.The ImmuMab\u00ae mouse platform enables efficient development of antibody therapeutics across multiple formats. Its robust immune responses and high repertoire diversity make it a powerful tool for generating high-quality candidates, even against challenging targets.Citation Format:Yuan Li, Wenbao Wu, Yu Wei, Yingjun Zhao, Yu Zhang, Jiwei Zhang.

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer remains a leading cause of mortality in men. Despite significant advances in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), there remains a need for more durable treatment options with improved quality of life. STEAP1 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1) is a validated tumor-associated antigen, highly expressed in various solid tumors, including prostate cancer, with restricted expression in normal tissues. Most noteworthy, STEAP1 expression is sustained in metastatic sites and expressed even in PSMA-negative patients, thus potentially providing an opportunity of a targeted therapeutic approach to the majority of patients with mCRPC. ADRX-0405 is a novel STEAP1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), consisting of a humanized IgG1 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase inhibitor via a novel and stable cleavable linker at a drug-to-antibody ratio of 8 (DAR8). ADRX-0405 specifically binds STEAP1, induces H2AX phosphorylation and PARP cleavage in line with its payload mechanism of action, resulting in nanomolar and target-dependent cytotoxicity in tumor cells. In addition, ADRX-0405 exhibits a potent bystander activity, which translates to robust in vivo efficacy in xenograft models of prostate cancer with both high and low target expression. In a mouse clinical trial of patient-derived xenografts with varying STEAP1 expression levels, ADRX-0405 achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 83%. Detailed PD characterization study of ADRX-0405 confirms its mechanism of action as a DNA topoisomerase inhibitor, inducing apoptosis through increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and pH2AX. Notably, ADRX-0405 treatment also leads to upregulation of PD-L1 expression as a result of immunogenic cell death. DNA damage inducers such as topoisomerase inhibitors are known to synergize with DNA damage repair inhibitors such as PARP inhibitors. ADRX-0405 exhibited a strong synergistic effect on tumor growth when combined with PARP inhibitors, thus providing a compelling rationale for clinical combination opportunities. A payload distribution study in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated improved delivery of the payload to tumors over normal tissues and plasma driven by its excellent stability and PK profile. Compared to a STEAP1 antibody conjugated to deruxtecan, the estimated safety margin as determined by the ratio of free payload in tumor over normal tissues was improved by 2-3-fold. Consequently, ADRX-0405 was well tolerated in non-human primates repeat-dose toxicology evaluation. Strikingly, no toxicity was detected in the lungs, which is a known safety liability for the topoisomerase inhibitor payload class. In summary, the preclinical efficacy and safety profile of ADRX-0405 strongly supports its clinical evaluation in mCRPC. A phase 1a/b study with ADRX-0405 is initiated.Citation Format:Maria Shahmoradgoli, Andrew M. Hau, Oscar Betancourt, Felipe Acosta, Sam Janssen, Paul Datta, Anna Y. Wang, Peter P.

    "abstract": "AVA6103 is a novel peptide drug conjugate (PDC) based on proprietary pre|CISION\u00ae technology which incorporates a dipeptide that is specifically cleaved by Fibroblast Activation Protein \u03b1 (FAP). FAP is a post-proline protease that is overexpressed on the surface of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in many solid tumors, and facilitates delivery of pre|CISION\u00ae medicines specifically to the tumor microenvironment (TME). AVA6103 consists of exatecan, a potent Topoisomerase I warhead, covalently linked to a dipeptide containing a cleaving sequence (D-Ala-L-Pro), which is susceptible to hydrolysis by FAP but is resistant to hydrolysis by other mammalian proteases. Exatecan has been investigated both as a single agent and as a warhead in ADC therapeutics in the clinic. However, clinical utility of this family of warheads is limited by dose-limiting toxicities, including severe neutropenia. The exquisite selectivity of the pre|CISION\u00ae substrate to FAP results in release of exatecan warhead in the TME, greatly increasing the therapeutic window and hence reducing systemic exposure and associated toxicities. AVA6103 is a pre|CISION-enabled exatecan programme, with a candidate in IND-enabling studies. A series of compounds have been engineered with modifications in the capping-group and linker portions. Using structure-based drug design, clear structure-activity relationships have been established for affinity to, and susceptibility of linker cleavage by FAP and subsequent warhead release. Concentric partitioning algorithms show differential FAP expression in stromal regions closest to cancer cells vs. those more distal to cancer cells, in multiple indications. Multiplex-immunofluorescence (mIF) data also shows the spatial organization of blood vessels, FAP-positive CAFs, and adjacent FAP-negative cancer cells provide an ideal architecture for the delivery, cleavage, and warhead uptake of a FAP-enabled PDC. In a cancer cell line/fibroblast cell co-culture, AVA6103 demonstrates FAP-dependent release of exatecan and bystander cancer cell kill. In vivo studies demonstrate targeting and accumulation of warhead in the TME, resulting in tumor growth inhibition and complete tumor regressions. Tolerability profiles of AVA6103, allied with tumor growth inhibition efficacy, shows a greatly increased therapeutic window compared to conventional exatecan, with pharmacodynamic biomarkers demonstrating on-target activity of the warhead. The enhanced therapeutic index and efficacy data shown here supports the rationale to progress AVA6103 towards clinical development and supports wider utility of the pre|CISION\u00ae platform to target warheads to the tumor while reducing systemic dose-limiting toxicities.Citation Format:Curtis Rink, Tom Clough, Ellen Watts, Folake Orafidiya, Marine Houee, Cindy Tong, Victoria Juskaite, Michelle Morrow, David Jones, Francis Wilson.

    "abstract": "Introduction:BCMA CAR-T cell therapies have demonstrated superior efficacy, including in patients with extramedullary disease and high-risk cytogenetics, compared to BCMA-directed TCE or ADC. The longitudinal single cell analysis revealed that pre-existing T cell exhaustion and presence of highly proliferative plasma cells with Ag downregulation predisposed to early relapse post BCMA CAR-T. Moreover, shedding BCMA and suppressive TME also pose significant challenges for sustained clinical response. To tackle these obstacles, BCMA and GPRC5D bi-specific CAR-Ts were designed. GPRC5D is a promising therapeutic target for multiple myeloma (MM), as it - expresses exclusively on MM cells but not in normal tissues (except for hair follicles) and is independent of BCMA expression. Clinical studies confirmed the co-existence of single or double Ag positive MM subsets within the same patient, along with a rare occurrence of double-negative multiple myeloma plasma cells.Methods:Aiming to broadly and deeply eradicate MM subsets and achieve long-term remission, we\u2019ve developed bi-specific CAR-Ts exclusively targeting BCMA and GPRC5D. Our design incorporates novel VHH binders with optimized CAR design to enhance sensitivity and efficacy toward heterogenous MM cells in the presence of soluble BCMA, mitigate Ag escape, restore T cell functionality and improve expansion. We\u2019ve conducted the pre-clinical investigations to validate the activity, functionality and druggability of the bi-specific CAR-Ts.Results:Binding to GPRC5D and BCMA resulted in bi-specific CAR-T exhibiting improved immune cell activation, superior anti-tumor activity, and functionality over mono-CAR-T or benchmark, and enhanced target-dependent expansion under re-stress. Moreover, the bi-specific CAR-T retained its functionality against BCMA.KO or GPRC5D.KO cells, whereas the mono-CAR-T could not. Importantly, the optimized bi-specific CAR designs incorporating the novel BCMA VHH binder(s) showed robust cytotoxicity against MM cells with low Ag expression in the presence of high concentrations of soluble BCMA, suggesting their potential to effectively counteract the inhibitory effects of soluble BCMA in the serum of MM patients. Compared to mono-specific CAR-Ts, the bi-specific CAR-T showed robust efficacy in tumor eradication at low dose(s) in NSG mice xenografted with heterogeneous MM cell lines.Conclusions:The pre-clinical data of GPRC5D and BCMA bi-specific CAR-T exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy and persistence, mitigated Ag escape and preserved potency with shedding BCMA. Our findings provide support for the clinical investigation of the bi-specific CAR-T as a therapeutic approach to broadly and deeply deplete heterogenetic MM cell clones and subsets, potentially leading to durable responses in both newly diagnosed and R/R MM patients.Citation Format:Jincai Zhou, Xinran Luo, Kai Wu, Feifei Shi, Bixia Lei, Yanhong Xu, Joy Zhou, Xiaowen He.

    "abstract": "3D cancer models consisting of cancer and fibroblast cell lines (BioSPHEERs\u2122) exhibit complex morphology depending on the cell lines used. We recently reported that such 3D cancer models can be used for drug testing by measuring cell killing and cell survival [Nielsen et al 2024, doi: 10.3389/fonc.2024.1386097]. Chemotherapeutic agents, like 5-FU, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide, at a certain dose, kill the majority of cancer cells, but also normal cells in the body, thus causing unappreciated discomfort and side effects. In contrast, therapeutic immune cells, like TILs and CAR-T cells perform cancer cell specific killing. Importantly, our 3D cancer models also enable studies on T cell infiltration and T cell directed cell killing. PBMC-derived T cells added to heterospheroids infiltrated the structures without excessive killing, unless the T cells had been activated by CD3/CD28 beads, or primed with the respective cancer cell line ahead of mixing. In this study we first combined low (sub-lethal) dose of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU with subsequent administration of PBMCs. 5-FU was added to spheroids, consisting of mCherry-engineered HT29 cells and 1BR3G fibroblast, at day 7 after seeding and after 24 hours the 5-FU was removed and PBMCs were added. 5-FU added at 500 \u00b5M (high dose) caused dramatic killing measured by a luciferase assay, whereas the drug at 100 \u00b5M (low dose) appeared quite harmless to the cells in the spheroids. We next treated spheroids with the low dose of 5-FU and after 24 hours added T cells. After additional 72 hours, histological examination showed that the T cells themselves partly infiltrated the vehicle-treated spheroids, but caused little killing. However, the same T cells added to the 5-FU-treated spheroids caused excess killing, suggesting a synergistic effect of the two agents. We are currently testing more PBMC donors in combination with other therapeutic agents, including antibody drug conjugates (ADC). Our observations suggest that well-known chemotherapeutic agents applied at sub-lethal dose may enhance the effect of immune cell therapies. The combination treatment may retain or improve drug efficacy and at the same time reduce severe side effects caused by the chemotherapeutic agent. We propose that the use of 3D BioSPHEER\u2122 cancer models to study combination treatment, will allow better optimization of dosage and timing of combined chemo-immuno-therapy.Citation Format:Boye Schnack Nielsen, Natasha H.

    "abstract": "Background:Colorectal cancer is the third most prevalent type of cancer, with an incidence of nearly 2 million new cases annually, and ranks as the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. CDH17 is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion and epithelial homeostasis regulation. In normal physiology, CDH17 is predominantly localized on the lateral surfaces of intestinal and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells\u200b. However, it is frequently overexpressed and aberrantly localized in gastrointestinal tumors including colorectal, gastric, pancreatic and gastroesophageal carcinomas. We have developed SOT109, a proprietary CDH17 targeting exatecan-based antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and evaluated its preclinical safety and efficacy.Results:Immunohistochemical staining of patient tumor and healthy tissue microarrays confirmed CDH17 expression in normal tissues including the colon, stomach and small intestine, with pronounced expression in colorectal, gastric, and gastroesophageal junction tumors, consistent with previously published literature. SOT109 candidates were generated from a fully human CDH17 monoclonal antibody conjugated via a hydrophobic linker to exatecan, a cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. Candidates were selected by rigorous screening for optimal binding epitopes and affinity, together with binding, internalization, and cytotoxicity in vitro. SOT109 candidates demonstrated specific binding to CDH17 and selective internalization and killing of target-positive cancer cells. Lead candidates underwent evaluation in several preclinical in vivo mouse tumor models, including cell-derived and patient-derived xenografts. Treatment with SOT109 resulted in profound and sustained tumor regressions. The doses tested in these studies were well tolerated in mice, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed. Subsequent studies in non-human primates revealed a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile.Summary:SOT109 targets the overexpressed tumor antigen CDH17 and exhibits potent anti-tumor efficacy coupled with a clean safety profile in preclinical models of colorectal carcinoma. These data suggest that SOT109 holds significant potential as a therapeutic candidate for patients with gastrointestinal malignancies and supports the further clinical development of SOT109.Citation Format:Nataliia Kalynovska, Diana Hudecz, Matous Hrdinka, Ilona Prochazkova, Eliska Kohelova, Lenka Palova Jelinkova, Filip Jaburek, Tomas Zimmermann, Lukas Fojtik, Irena Adkins, Sarka Stehlikova, Amy Jensen-Smith, Radek Spisek, Martin Steegmaier.

    "abstract": "Patient-derived models have increasingly been adopted into target validation, lead-optimization and secondary screening campaigns to move translation ahead in drug discovery. While 2-dimentional cell line in vitro models continue to play a pivotal role in early screening studies, new advanced in 3D patient derived organoids (PDO) and patient derived xenograft organoids (PDX-O) technology have made it suitable to meet the rigor and reproducibility of traditional screening metrics. At Champions Oncology, we have built a successful pipeline of ex vivo models from pre-treated, metastatic, and genetically diverse cohorts across varied indications. PDX-derived cell cultures serve as (i) physiologically relevant high throughput platforms for early or clinical hypothesis testing, (ii) cellular systems to gain mechanistic and phenotypic insights into drug mode of action in 3D tumor microenvironment, and (iii) cost-effective translational bridge to well-informed in vivo studies. Ex vivo models have been widely established and characterized for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal (CRC), and other epithelial tumor types. Indications such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), gastric and bladder cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), prostate cancer, and sarcoma are less common and often a size-able cohort size rarely exists. In this poster, we showcase our recent efforts on the iterative media optimization process, growth kinetics, and morphology of models from these rare indications and characterization data that establish them front and center as valid preclinical screening tools. Through careful media formulation, the appropriate standard of care controls (SoC), and vigorous assay development criteria we show the versatility of these models for both efficacy and complex mechanistic readouts when probed with various modalities including antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and anti-sense oligos (ASO). Our experience establishing 3D microstructures from various indications by iterative optimization of culture conditions is further validated by our comprehensive quality control (QC) procedures and deep molecular and pharmacological characterization. In summary, through a series of examples, we highlight the application of Champions TumorGraft3D Ex vivo models in enhancing the biological and clinical fidelity of novel modalities of drugs and/or novel drug combinations.Citation Format:Fu-Ju Chou, Annamaria Rapisarda, Mara Gilardi, Stefano Cairo, BanuPriya Sridharan.

    "abstract": "Human natural killer (NK) and T cells are essential cytotoxic effectors in tumor surveillance and elimination, with an increasingly important role in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies. While current ICIs have focused on inhibitory receptors on T cells, creating a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, challenges remain due to non-responders and treatment-associated adverse events. There is a growing need for alternatives that address these limitations and for strategies that enhance efficacy through combination with existing ICIs.In this study, we developed IMB-202, a therapeutic anti-cancer antibody designed to target the ligands (TOI, Target of Interest), which are overexpressed on tumor cells, of an immune checkpoint receptor on NK and T cells. This TOI plays a crucial role in tumor escape mechanisms by transmitting inhibitory signals to NK and T cells. While this target holds significant promise for ICIs, its development as a therapeutic antibody has been particularly challenging due to the high sequence homology among related family proteins, which complicates achieving the specificity.Through advanced phage display screening and affinity maturation, we successfully developed IMB-202 as a highly selective TCR-like antibody, capable of recognizing even a single amino acid difference in peptide sequences. IMB-202 binds with high affinity and specificity to TOI in various cancer cell lines and efficiently kills cancer cells by disrupting the immune evasion mechanisms, followed by activating NK and T cells, as well as through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. Additionally, IMB-202 demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition in an in vivo xenograft mouse model. When applied to ePENDY technology, IMBiologics\u2019 proprietary multivalent antibody platform, IMB-202-ePENDY demonstrated enhanced avidity and increased NK and T cell cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Furthermore, its rapid internalization of IMB-202 supports its potential as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) candidate, with robust internalization also observed in the ePENDY platform format.These findings highlight IMB-202 as a promising alternative to existing ICIs and as a first-in-class therapy, targeting a novel immune checkpoint ligand with exceptional selectivity. Additionally, IMB-202 demonstrates significant potential for superior anti-tumor efficacy, with the versatility to be applied across various therapeutic modalities.Citation Format:Inyoung Lee, Hyeonju Kang, Chaerin Yoo, Hong Jai Lee, Sungmuk Kang, Sunghyun Byun, Yongjun Kang, Chungmin Lee, Gyongsik Ha.

    "abstract": "Histological screening of tumor biopsies is the gold standard for identifying actionable biomarkers, but is invasive and non-representative, especially for patients with advanced or inaccessible tumors. Imaging with targeted positron emission tomography (PET) may provide a more complete view of the cancer and guide therapy. PET imaging, with a targeting ligand, is preferred for evaluating tumor avidity of new radiolabeled molecular entities. Raptamers (aptamers with amino acid-like functionality) combine attractive attributes of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in targeted delivery of radionuclides. Like mAbs, Raptamers can provide low nM to pM binding affinities with very low off-rates. Unlike mAbs, they are smaller (with a potentially broader volume of distribution), are manufactured synthetically (less expensive and more consistency), and are more stable. Radionuclide-labeled Raptamers (Radiomers\u00ae) can be used for both imaging and therapeutics. We are developing a Radiomer to image, and potentially treat, c-Met over-expressing cancers with minimal off-target effects. c-Met protein is over-expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); with up to 70% in adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 40% in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Overexpression promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. The expression level of c-Met correlates with response to c-Met-targeted therapy. The discovery campaign identified multiple high-affinity Raptamers for c-Met, confirmed using biolayer interferometry, and a lead candidate was selected. For surrogate studies, we conjugated Raptamers with a fluorescent tag (Cy5) at the 5\u2019 end. Cy5-Raptamers showed internalization into c-Met+ cells and accumulated, in vivo, in c-Met+ tumors in mice. Additional modifications on the 3\u2019 end improved the biodistribution profile. We then optimized click chemistry reaction conditions to conjugate a DOTA chelator at the 5\u2019 end of Raptamers with a high degree of reproducibility and purity. Stability tests confirmed in vitro integrity of the DOTA conjugates, followed by successful radiolabeling trials with 86Ga and 177Lu. The tests showed higher loading efficiency of Lu over Ga, but we were able to proceed with further studies using both isotopes.177Lu-Radiomers demonstrated cell surface binding and rapid clearance in mice. 177Lu-Radiomers also showed promising biodistribution in tumor bearing mouse models. hese studies provide the first proof-of-concept data of Radiomers in targeted molecular imaging of cancer. Molecular imaging can potentially allow detection and monitoring of lung cancers with abnormal alterations of c-Met in real time. Also, Radiomers can focus radioactive decay to the vicinity of or within the tumor cells, leading to therapeutic options. In this way, Radiomers can potentially target any cell-surface neo-antigen and open up new diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms in cancer.Citation Format:Sougata Dey, Uksha Saini, Stephanie Vega, Secondra L.

    "abstract": "Therapeutic antibodies have become important drugs in the field of targeted therapy because of their high specificity to target antigens. Currently, over 100 antibody drugs have been approved for the treatment of various human diseases, yet the targets covered are indeed limited, with approximately half of these drugs targeting only 10 common targets. Approved drugs encompass not only monoclonal antibodies but also antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and antibody fragments. The scarcity of antibody drug targets and subsequent conjugation or engineering modifications pose challenges for the development of novel antibody drugs. In response to the growing demand for fully human antibody drugs, Biocytogen\u2019s antibody discovery team has generated a library of antibodies targeting hundreds of antigens using fully human antibody transgenic mice (RenMice). Our RenMice undergo additional gene-editing procedures to knock out designated target genes. Subsequently, antibodies obtained by conventional immunization have a wide range of epitope-binding properties to homologous protein targets, but also exhibit cross-species reactivity. We have completed over 900 fully human antibody target projects and established a library containing over four hundred thousand off-the-shelf fully human antibody sequences. The antibodies generated from RenMice can be used in a variety of applications, and many of the TAA (tumor-associated antigen)-targeting antibodies have been screened for internalization activity to ensure suitability for ADC development. In addition to fully human monoclonal antibody derived from RenMab platform (fully human immunoglobulin variable domains replacing the mouse loci), RenLite-derived common light chain antibodies are easy to assemble into bispecific antibodies (BsAb) with low mismatch rate and ideal physiochemical properties, which are suitable for BsADC, biparatopic antibody (BpAb) and other modalities. Small and flexible fully human nanobodies based on RenNano platform (fully human heavy chain only) also provide solutions for specific antigen epitopes or multi-targets, multi-epitope antigens. Thus, the fully human antibody library can accelerate the development of antibody drugs.Citation Format:Ting Yi, Jun Du, Yue Zhang, Yuting Hu, Shujin Zhang, Xin Ji, Yi Yang.

    "abstract": "Cancer is one of a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with current treatments facing limitations such as drug resistance and relapse. To address these issues, the use of advanced in vitro models, such as patient-derived organoids (PDOs), is crucial. Unlike conventional 2D cultures, PDOs closely resemble the biological characteristics of tumors, thereby allowing the prediction of responses to drugs and supporting personalized therapies. Gradiant Bioconvergence (GBCC) has established a biobank comprising over 800 PDOs derived from tissue or metastatic samples of patients with lung, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. The biobank also includes NGS datasets of genomics and transcriptomics, as well as clinical information, including treatment history, and autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). PDOs are highly effective models for evaluating drug efficacy in vitro, capable of predicting clinical drug responses and providing valuable insights for the development of new therapeutics. GBCC has developed two distinct organoid-based drug screening platforms for evaluating various cancer therapies. The first drug screening platform employs organoids alone to evaluate anti-cancer drugs, including chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Additionally, the platform is capable of supporting mono or combination drug screenings. Of note, lung PDOs with driver mutations, such as EGFR and KRAS, demonstrated responsiveness to targeted drugs, with results that aligned with the patient\u2019s treatment history. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), including Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd), exhibited sensitivity in HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer organoids and lung cancer organoids with HER2 mutations. To evaluate immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the GBCC has developed a second drug screening platform using autologous T cell co-culture with organoid models. Flow cytometry was employed to ascertain organoid viability and cytokine release by T cells, thereby confirming that the viability of cancer organoids was reduced in the presence of ICIs. The results demonstrate that our organoid-based drug screening platforms can be utilized to assess drug responsiveness, thus representing a valuable tool for the preclinical evaluation of drugs, and supporting the advancement of precision medicine and the discovery of new anti-cancer drugs.Citation Format:Na-Gyeong Lee, Misun Park, Sang-Eun Park, Hyeon-A Kim, Sang-yeon Lee, Jinguen Rheey, Ji-Yeon Park.

    "abstract": "Cadherins are Ca2+-dependent cell adhesion molecules that mediates cell-to-cell adhesion and plays a key role in tissue development. Classical cadherins, such as E-cadherin (CDH1), N-cadherin (CDH2), P-cadherin (CDH3), and VE-cadherin (CDH5) are implicated in cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis when their expression or function changes.CDH17 (Cadeherin-17, LI-cadherin) is a structurally unique member of the cadherin superfamily, with seven extracellular EC repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a shorter cytoplasmic domain. Originally discovered in rat liver and intestine, CDH17 is also called liver and intestine cadherin. In humans, the expression of CDH17 is mainly limited to the digestive tract, including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, pancreas, and is rarely detected in other tissues. In the intestinal epithelium, CDH17 is mainly localized to lateral and basolateral cell membranes.CDH17 overexpression is observed in various gastrointestinal malignancies, such as gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, bile duct cancer, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, with almost no expression in normal tissues and organs. High expression of CDH17 is also associated with poor prognosis. The tumorigenic role of CDH17 involves interaction with \u03b12\u03b21 integrin to regulate cell adhesion, proliferation and migration, particularly in colon cancer liver metastasis, making CDH17 a promising therapeutic target in cancer research.BR116 is a novel anti-CDH17 ADC that consists of a humanized, highly specific monoclonal antibody, stably conjugated to an innovative topoisomerase I inhibitor with hydrophilic linker. Notably, our unique conjugation platform CysX\u2122 offers site-specific, stable and irreversible conjugation. CysX\u2122 not only prevents payload detachment during circulation and reducing the off-target toxicity, improved therapeutic window, but also enables a uniformed drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4. The toxin was carefully selected based on the target characterization and cancer cell sensitivity.BR116 has demonstrated remarkable antitumor activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Preclinical evaluations have shown strong safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys, indicating its potential as a therapeutic treatment for gastrointestinal cancers. With its enhanced safety profile and promising efficacy, BR116 holds significant potential for further clinical development. BR116 is aiming to file for an IND in 2025.Citation Format:Xiaobei Zhao, Jie Zhu, Zhenhua Wu, Yiqun Li, Cindy Wu, Lei Nie, Haibin Wang, Gang Chen.

    "abstract": "Antibody drug development is lengthy and complex, often hindered by various challenges in clinical advancement. Reports indicate that off-target binding of antibodies may be a significant issue, with approximately 25% of preclinical candidates potentially experiencing these off-target problems. With the rise of new modalities such as CD3 bispecific antibodies, ADCs, and CAR-T therapies, preliminary off-target screening of antibodies has become increasingly important. Despite the use of techniques like immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and flow cytometry (FACS) for off-target testing of antibodies, these methods still exhibit limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. To address the need for antibody target deconvolution and receptor identification, we developed a novel membrane protein screening array (MPSA) AB5000. MPSA-AB5000 is a high-throughput, cell-based platform for identifying antibody targets and off-targets, enhancing antibody specificity screening and reducing development risks. The MPSA-AB5000 covers diverse human membrane proteins, expressed in live cells to preserve native conformations. C-terminal epitope-tagged clones allow for expression confirmation and cellular localization. To provide the highest level of sensitivity, MPSA-AB5000 uses luciferase reporter cell line detection. The wash-free strategy reduces false negatives, and signal amplification makes remarkable discrimination. Compared to similar technologies, we possess significant advantages in the following aspects: a. High sensitivity and sigh throughput: our technology platform offers not only high sensitivity, capable of detecting subtle interactions but also supports high-throughput screening, allowing for the evaluation of a large number of samples in a short timeframe. b. Avoidance of false negative signals: by eliminating washing steps, our method reduces the risk of false negative signals, ensuring reliable detection of non-specific binding. c. Comprehensive validation approaches: we employ various validation methods such as FACS and ELISA to eliminate false positive signals, enhancing the accuracy and credibility of our results. All the advantages ensure that MPSA-AB5000 is more rapid, simple, and highly sensitive than traditional assays.Citation Format:Liping Wang, Yuanyuan Sun, Guoqian Wang, Jinying Ning, Feng Hao.

    "abstract": "Targeted delivery technologies (ADC, TRT, etc.) are commonly dose-limited by off-target toxicities. Less than 1% of the dose is delivered to the tumor while the remainder follows the normal catabolic elimination route of the antigen-binder resulting in significant normal tissue exposure and toxicity. A pre-targeting approach such as Shasqi\u2019s Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC\u00ae) technology, that separates the antigen-binder from the payload and reunites them only at the antigen is needed to overcome this limitation. CAPAC utilizes in-vivo click chemistry to selectively and rapidly reunite antigen-binders and payloads. Here we present preclinical data on a clickable CEACAM5 antigen-binder and a clickable monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload or protodrug. We synthesized a clickable binder for CEACAM5 consisting of fragment antibodies covalently conjugated with the activating agent. The microtubule-disruptor, MMAE, was chemically attenuated with trans-cyclooctene to develop the protodrug, SQP22 (clickable payload). Both the clickable binder and protodrug were tested individually in vitro, with or without cells. They are currently being tested in vivo, individually or together, for efficacy and tolerability in naive tumor-free or tumor bearing CEACAM5-expressing cell-derived xenograft (CDX) rodent models. SQP22 showed a high level of attenuation (up to \u223c700x) in cytotoxicity assays in vitro compared to the active payload and cleared rapidly in vivo, both important features of CAPAC protodrugs. Additionally, the drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic characterization showed a favorable drug profile for SQP22, supporting its further development as a clinical agent of the CAPAC platform. The CEACAM5-targeted Fab has a binding affinity (KD) of 0.046 nM and a strong binding potency of 0.78 nM (EC50) to a CEACAM5-expressing cell line. Efficacy data from gastric and pancreatic CDX models shows that the clickable binder with SQP22 significantly improves tumor growth inhibition over a clickable non-binding isotype control with SQP22 and other negative controls. Tolerability studies in rats at various dose levels are ongoing. We have developed a novel, first-in-class, CEACAM5 clickable binder that can selectively activate an MMAE payload using click chemistry-based pre-targeting. Our results show that the protodrug and the clickable binder have favorable characteristics. Moreover, efficacy data indicate a meaningful benefit in cancer CDX models over negative controls. These data support the continued development of CEACAM5 clickable binder in combination with MMAE clickable payload for the treatment of CEACAM5 expressing cancers.Citation Format:George Coricor, Masa Aleckovic, Sangeetha Srinivasan, Jesse McFarland, Stefanie Wagner, Nathan A.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key components of the tumor microenvironment and play a critical role in tumor progression and therapy resistance. Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) enable precise analysis of gene expression within the spatial context of tissues, offering new avenues for target discovery. Using spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data, we identified a novel target protein, POR-CAF-001, predominantly expressed in CAFs within solid tumor tissues and minimally in normal tissues, making it a promising candidate for therapeutic intervention. Method Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data from human tumor samples were analyzed using our proprietary target discovery program to identify CAF-specific targets. Two human IgG antibodies (POR-CAF-001-01 and POR-CAF-001-02) against the POR-CAF-001 were generated through phage display, ELISA screening and recombinant production in mammalian cells. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to validate a binding affinity of antibodies against POR-CAF-001 protein. Also, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry (ICC) were performed to evaluate the binding specificity of the antibodies. Antibody internalization was assessed via an imaging-based internalization assay using pH-sensitive fluorophore-labeled antibodies, and their internalization was monitored over time. POR-CAF-001-positive, -negative and knockout cell lines were used to confirm binding specificity and internalization. Results Differential expression and spatial specificity analyses identified POR-CAF-001 with high expression in various types of tumor tissues with minimal expression in normal tissues. SPR analysis demonstrated binding affinities (KD) of 1.15 nM and 4.1 nM for POR-CAF-001-01 and POR-CAF-001-02, respectively. Flow cytometry and ICC analyses confirmed robust binding of both antibodies to POR-CAF-001-positive cells, with negligible binding in POR-CAF-001-negative and the target knockout cells. Both antibodies showed substantial internalization in POR-CAF-001-positive cells during the internalization assay, while minimal internalization was observed in the negative cell line. Conclusion Through our target discovery program with ST data, we identified POR-CAF-001 as a novel CAF-specific target protein and developed two human IgG antibodies against it. These antibodies demonstrated high specificity and successful internalization in target-positive cells. These findings provide a solid foundation for further preclinical development, including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) or other therapeutic modalities targeting POR-CAF-001. Our study underscores the potential of ST in identifying novel targets and advancing cancer therapy.Citation Format:Jin Yeong Choi, Shengjun Li, MinKyu Kim, Yeonjae Jung, Jae Eun Lee, Daeseung Lee, Hongyoon Choi, Hyung-Jun Im.

    "abstract": "HER2 alterations such as amplification, overexpression, insertions, and point mutations, are established oncogenic drivers in many solid tumors. Activating HER2 mutations are found in 2-4% of advanced lung cancers and have emerged as mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies. Patients with HER2 mutant lung tumors develop more brain metastasis during treatment than patients with any other oncogenic drivers in lung cancer. Addressing brain metastasis in this group of patients remains a clinical challenge with limited therapeutic options. Approved HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors have inferior potency against key mutations and lack sufficient brain penetration to be an impactful treatment option for patients with brain metastasis. Herein, we describe advanced preclinical profiling of an EGFR-sparing, HER2 inhibitor clinical development candidate CGT4255 with potential best-in-class brain penetrance and potent activity across prevalent point mutations and exon 20 YVMA insertions. CGT4255 demonstrates robust efficacy in intracranial tumor growth inhibition studies and shows an additive effect on intracranial tumor shrinkage when combined with a HER2 ADC. Pre-clinical studies with the CGT4255 and T-DXd combination demonstrate enhancement of ADC internalization, thus highlighting a biological rationale for combination therapy.Citation Format:Mark J.

    "abstract": "Purpose:Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a key therapy for HER2+/HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (mBC), but up to 50% of patients develop resistance. Resistance mechanisms have implicated dysfunctions in DNA repair, lysosomal activity, and immune responses. This study combines spatial omics and quantum-inspired regulatory network analysis to investigate tumor-immune-extracellular matrix interactions contributing to T-DXd resistance.Methods:Using NanoString GeoMX, spatial proteomics were analyzed in 29 metastatic tissue sections from 15 responsive (R) and 14 non-responsive (NR) patients. Across 6-8 regions of interest per section, immune and stromal components were quantified. Additionally, a subset of samples (n = 2R, 2NR) underwent GeoMX whole transcriptomics profiling and analysis using both classical and quantum-inspired algorithms.Results:NR tumors consistently exhibited immunosuppression, disorganized immune responses, upregulated fibronectin, and poor infiltration of granzyme B-producing cells. Organ-specific findings included:\u2022NR bone and brain mets showed increased spatial correlations between dendritic cells and T-cell exhaustion markers (PD-L1, CTLA4), suggesting niches of immune suppression.\u2022NR bone mets showed increased spatial correlation of fibronectin correlated with immune markers, indicating that stiffer ECM physically blocks immune infiltration. \u2022R chest wall mets showed upregulated smooth muscle actin (SMA), possibly reflecting vascular remodeling and enhanced immune infiltration.Additionally, spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed the following::\u2022Tumor-associated B cells were identified in NR samples, interacting with exhausted T cells and the Wnt-catenin pathway. \u2022QuantumGRN revealed interactions in immune cells involving RBPP4 with DNMT3A and TAF4, linked to altered chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, respectively.Conclusions:This work shows that T-DXd response is heavily influenced by microenvironment remodeling and immune infiltration. This work highlights the value of spatial omics for uncovering ADC-resistance mechanisms, as well as the value of quantum-inspired computing for identifying novel therapeutic targets. In addition to collecting more spatial and single-cell omics data, future directionsinclude pathway validation in animal models and computationally simulating quantum and molecular dynamics of ADC resistance.Citation Format:Glori Das, Wenjuan Dong, Matthew Vasquez, Ji-hoon Lee, Yuan Gao, Jenny Chang, Xiaoxian Li, Hong Zhao, Stephen T.

    "abstract": "Nectin-4-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) linked with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for metastatic bladder cancer. In combination with pembrolizumab, this therapy has doubled overall survival compared to conventional platinum-based chemotherapy. However, challenges such as drug toxicity and the accumulation of resistance to MMAE limit its therapeutic potential. In this study, we introduce a novel Nectin-4-targeted gene therapy strategy employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This advanced gene-editing tool, known for its precise induction of double-strand DNA breaks, was adapted to create over 50 random double-strand breaks (referred to as MT50) in target cells, leading to apoptotic cell death. To address the critical challenge of delivering gene-editing tools efficiently and specifically to cancer cells, we developed a highly efficient nucleic acid encapsulation system with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle. This platform demonstrated high nucleic acid encapsulation efficiency, exceeding 60% for plasmids (\u223c1 kb) and 80% for shorter RNAs, such as siRNA. The system was further optimized for encapsulating CRISPR/Cas9 components, including guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 mRNA. The T24 bladder cancer cell line, characterized by high Nectin-4 expression, was used as the experimental model. In vitro experiments demonstrated that MT50 delivery via Nectin-4-conjugated PLGA nanoparticles inhibited cellular proliferation by over 70%. In vivo, the nanoparticles were administered systemically through intraperitoneal injection into a murine model bearing T24 bladder cancer tumors. Tumor volume decreased by 70% following MT50 treatment, with significant downregulation of Nectin-4 expression observed in treated tumors compared to controls. While this experiment was conducted in immunocompromised mice, precluding the assessment of immunogenic cell death or synergistic effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors, we anticipate enhanced anti-tumor efficacy in immunocompetent models. Specifically, combining MT50 treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is expected to amplify therapeutic outcomes. This study highlights the successful development of a Nectin-4-targeted PLGA nanoparticle system capable of efficiently encapsulating and delivering CRISPR/Cas9 components to bladder cancer cells. The MT50 delivery system demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, offering a promising alternative to MMAE-linked ADCs. By circumventing cumulative resistance and leveraging the precision of gene editing, this approach has the potential to redefine bladder cancer therapeutics.Citation Format:Seung-hwan Jeong, Seokbong Hong, Hyeong Dong Yuk, Cheol Kwak.

    "abstract": "Context:Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype accounting for 15-20% of breast cancer cases, characterized by poor prognosis, high recurrence rates, and limited treatment options. The lack of hormone receptors associated with a high level of molecular heterogeneity of TNBC hinders the development of effective therapies. Chemotherapy remains the standard of care but is often compromised by resistance and toxicity, emphasizing the urgent need for innovative treatments. Here, we assess the efficacy of XON7, a first-in-class glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb), in preclinical models of TNBC.Methods:The anti-tumor efficacy of XON7 was assessed in TNBC cell lines for its capacity to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and apoptosis, compared to paclitaxel and the ADC Sacituzumab Govitecan. Apoptotic mechanisms were explored by evaluating caspase 8/9 activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential. In vitro 3D cultures, XON7's ability to inhibit tumor growth, spheroid formation, and metastasis was tested. In vivo antitumor efficacy was evaluated in orthotopic and metastatic models in SRG rats inoculated with MDA-MB-231-Luc cells, using bioluminescence imaging.Results:XON7 demonstrated potent and selective cytotoxicity across human TNBC cell lines (80-100% cytotoxicity), sparing healthy PBMCs. Apoptotic induction involved both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, evidenced by caspase 8/9 activation, ROS generation, and mitochondrial membrane potential loss. In 3D cultures, XON7 reduced spheroid size by 50% after two treatments (300 \u00b5g/ml) and significantly decreased cancer cell viability (28% remaining). Pre-treatment with XON7 prevented spheroid formation, outperforming paclitaxel and sacituzumab govitecan. XON7 also inhibited metastasis in transwell invasion assays. In vivo, bi-weekly XON7 treatments reduced tumor growth by 50% and eliminated lung metastases in an orthotopic rat model. In a metastatic model, tri-weekly XON7 treatments reduced total metastases (lung, liver, etc.) by 90%.Conclusion:XON7 is a multi-target antibody currently under clinical evaluation, it represents a promising candidate for advancing treatment paradigms in TNBC.Citation Format:Carine Ciron, Oph\u00e9lie Dauphouy, Pierre-Joseph Royer, Pierre Morice, Odile Duvaux, Firas Bassissi.

    "abstract": "Patient-derived models have increasingly been adopted into target validation, lead-optimization and secondary screening campaigns to move translation ahead in drug discovery. While 2-dimentional cell line in vitro models continue to play a pivotal role in early screening studies, new advanced in 3D patient derived organoids (PDO) and patient derived xenograft organoids (PDX-O) technology have made it suitable to meet the rigor and reproducibility of traditional screening metrics. At Champions Oncology, we have built a successful pipeline of ex vivo models from pre-treated, metastatic, and genetically diverse cohorts across varied indications. PDX-derived cell cultures serve as (i) physiologically relevant high throughput platforms for early or clinical hypothesis testing, (ii) cellular systems to gain mechanistic and phenotypic insights into drug mode of action in 3D tumor microenvironment, and (iii) cost-effective translational bridge to well-informed in vivo studies. Ex vivo models have been widely established and characterized for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal (CRC), and other epithelial tumor types. Indications such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), gastric and bladder cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), prostate cancer, and sarcoma are less common and often a size-able cohort size rarely exists. In this poster, we showcase our recent efforts on the iterative media optimization process, growth kinetics, and morphology of models from these rare indications and characterization data that establish them front and center as valid preclinical screening tools. Through careful media formulation, the appropriate standard of care controls (SoC), and vigorous assay development criteria we show the versatility of these models for both efficacy and complex mechanistic readouts when probed with various modalities including antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and anti-sense oligos (ASO). Our experience establishing 3D microstructures from various indications by iterative optimization of culture conditions is further validated by our comprehensive quality control (QC) procedures and deep molecular and pharmacological characterization. In summary, through a series of examples, we highlight the application of Champions TumorGraft3D Ex vivo models in enhancing the biological and clinical fidelity of novel modalities of drugs and/or novel drug combinations.Citation Format:Fu-Ju Chou, Annamaria Rapisarda, Mara Gilardi, Stefano Cairo, BanuPriya Sridharan.

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating EGFR mutations, such as exon 19 deletions (del746-750) and the L858R point mutation in exon 21, respond well to third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like osimertinib. However, resistance inevitably emerges, limiting the long-term efficacy of these therapies. In this study, we investigated non-genomic mechanisms contributing to TKI resistance, focusing on the activation of bypass pathways that facilitate drug tolerance. These pathways enable drug tolerant persister cells to survive EGFR inhibition by exploiting alternative signaling routes. Among these, the upregulation of HER3 has been identified as a key mechanism. Clinical evidence has demonstrated the therapeutic potential of targeting HER3, notably with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) like patritumab deruxtecan. However, the precise molecular and cellular basis for HER3 dependency in NSCLC patients who progress on TKI therapy remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we employed a combination of immortalized and patient-derived cell lines, alongside advanced single-cell sequencing technologies, to elucidate the underlying biology. Our findings reveal that HER3 dependency post-TKI treatment is specifically enriched in pulmonary alveolar type I and II cells. This dependency is driven and maintained by paracrine signaling involving secreted factors, with neuregulin-1 (NRG1) playing a central role. NRG1 is primarily secreted by the tumor stroma and by cancer cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or dedifferentiation. Prolonged drug exposure further amplifies NRG1 secretion, which not only sustains HER3 activation but also promotes genetic and phenotypic plasticity. This is accompanied by EMT-associated morphological changes that enhance invasiveness and metastatic potential. Notably, our preclinical models demonstrated that the combination of an NRG1-neutralizing antibody with a dual EGFR blockade\u2014achieved through a TKI and an anti-EGFR antibody\u2014completely eradicated tumors in vivo. These results highlight the critical role of HER3 signaling and its interplay with the tumor microenvironment in mediating TKI resistance and suggest a compelling therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance in NSCLC.Citation Format:Alessandra Morselli, Donatella Romaniello, Chiara Miroglio, Martina Mazzeschi, Michela Sgarzi, Federica Pagano, Cinzia Girone, Francesca Ambrosi, William Kothalawala, Gyorffy Bal\u00e1zs, Andrea De Giglio, Michelangelo Fiorentino, Andrea Ardizzoni, Yosef Yarden, Mattia Lauriola.

    "abstract": "Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), also known as fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-nxki, is a novel HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that has shown remarkable clinical efficacy in breast cancer (BC) and other cancers with varying levels of HER2 expression. However, the mechanisms underlying its activity in HER2-low and HER2-ultralow BC, and the role of immune activation, remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that T-DXd\u2019s efficacy in HER2-low/ultralow BC is predominantly driven by the extracellular tumor-specific protease Cathepsin L (CTSL), but not Ccathepsin B (CTSB). Our in vitro and in vivo studies reveal that extracellular CTSL cleaves T-DXd\u2019s linker, releasing the DXd payload (validated by mass spectrometry) and inducing cytotoxicity within HER2-low/ultralow tumor microenvironments. This mechanism mediates potent anti-tumor effects across multiple HER2-negative cancers. Importantly, analysis of BC biopsies and tissue microarrays from T-DXd-treated patients revealed high CTSL expression in tumor and stromal compartments, independent of HER2 levels, suggesting broad therapeutic potential. In addition to extracellular cleavage, we also found that T-DXd elicits immune activation as an anti-tumor mechanism in HER2-positive BC. The DXd payload induces immunogenic cell death, activating nearby myeloid immune cells via TLR4 and STING pathways, while its antibody backbone engages Fc\u03b3-receptors to stimulate Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP). This process enhances tumor antigen uptake and drives the expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, DXd upregulates CD47 on tumor cells, making them more susceptible to immune clearance. Combining CD47 blockade with T-DXd significantly enhanced anti-tumor efficacy in an immune suppressive HER2-transgenic BC mouse model, promoting CD8+ T cell memory and preventing tumor recurrence post-treatment. These studies suggest that strategies targeting the CD47-SIRPa axis may enhance the ability of ADCs to elicit tumor-specific immunity, thus extending the efficacy of these agents and generating long term memory responses against non-immunogenic cancers.Citation Format:Li-Chung Tsao, John S.

    "abstract": "Introduction.The clinical prognosis for children with high-risk neuroblastoma, a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system, remains poor. Non-invasive imaging biomarkers of treatment response are essential for precision medicine. Here, we evaluated a supervised machine learning model trained on co-registered MRI-histology maps to predict density maps of key neuroblastoma cell populations (undifferentiated, differentiating, apoptotic) directly from multi-parametric mpMRI in murine models of neuroblastoma.Methods.Tumour MRI parametric maps for spin-lattice relaxation time (T1,  sensitive to undifferentiated cells), transverse relaxation rate (R2*, sensitive to red blood cells), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, sensitive to cell density) were co-registered with digitized H&E slides (20x, 0.46\u03bcm resolution) from 11 Th-MYCN mice. Automated cell segmentation/classification into 6 categories allowed for the generation of density maps at MRI resolution.Classical ML models were trained to simultaneously predict 5 histological labels using a supervised regression approach on 9095 MRI voxels (n=4 mice), each represented by 5 normalized input features: R2*, T1, and ADC, along with median values of the pixels\u2019 square neighbourhood (2px wide). Model performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and the negative mean-squared-error metric before application to remaining tumours.Results/Discussion. The random forest classifier achieved the lowest mean-squared-error and smallest variation during the 10-fold cross-validation and was selected as the best model. Extra trees, XGBoost and light-gradient-boosting machines also performed well.The similarity of the entire MRI-generated maps (for all 11 mice in the dataset) was compared to the histology maps using the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) metrics. The model achieved an average MSE of 0.0037, 0.0089, 0.0016, 0.0014, and 0.0008 for cellular density, undifferentiated neuroblasts, apoptotic neuroblasts, differentiating neuroblasts and red blood cells density respectively. The SSIM indexes were 0.90, 0.88, 0.90, 0.88 and 0.92 for cellular density, undifferentiated neuroblasts\u2019, apoptotic neuroblasts\u2019, differentiating neuroblasts\u2019 and red blood cells density respectively.Conclusion.This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that mpMRI can characterize neuroblastoma phenotypes and generate quantitative data previously accessible only through digital histology analysis, including cellular density maps. Validation in more diverse datasets could enable \u201cnon-invasive\u201d or \u201cvirtual\u201d biopsies, capturing entire tumour volume to enhance diagnostic precision, guide surgical planning, and refine response assessment.Citation Format:Konstantinos Zormpas-Petridis, Matthew Blackledge, Louis Chesler, Yinyin Yuan, Simon P.

    "abstract": "Background:Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Targeted therapies offer a promising approach to improve treatment efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity. Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in multiple cancers including lung cancer. Trop-2 is an ideal candidate for targeted therapy of NSCLC as it is highly expressed in NSCLC in comparison to normal cells and it is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain that can be targeted by therapies. Recently various Trop-2-targeted therapies have been investigated in clinical trials, including anti-Trop-2 antibodies and Trop-2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). This study aims to discover a Trop-2 specific peptide using phage display biopanning and develop a liposomal formulation surface-modified with the identified peptide for targeted chemo-immunotherapy.Methods:A peptide phage display library was screened to identify peptides with high affinity for Trop-2 protein. The selected Trop-2 peptide was conjugated to the surface of liposomes encapsulating cisplatin and anti-PDL1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv). The targeting efficiency, cytotoxicity, and immunomodulatory effects of the Trop-2 peptide-modified liposomes were evaluated in vitro using A549 lung cancer cell lines and in vivo in Calu-3 NSCLC xenograft model.Results:The phage display biopanning successfully identified a high-affinity Trop-2 peptide. Liposomes modified with this peptide demonstrated enhanced binding and uptake by A549 lung cancer cells compared to non-targeted liposomes. In vivo, the targeted liposomal formulation exhibited superior tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival in the Calu-3 NSCLC xenograft model.Conclusion:The discovery of a Trop-2 specific peptide via phage display and its application in targeted liposomal delivery of cisplatin and anti-PDL1 scFv represents a novel and effective strategy for lung cancer chemo-immunotherapy. This approach holds potential for improving therapeutic outcomes and minimizing adverse effects in lung cancer patients.Citation Format:Bahaa S.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Many approvals of advanced drugs, such as Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) or immunotherapies, have not provided significant treatment benefits for patients with metastatic gastric cancer (GC). There remains an urgent need to develop novel therapies. However, the lack of well-defined oncogene targets has hindered progress in therapy development. A patient-like disease model was established using patient samples and a 3D co-culture platform, the Microphysiological System (MPS). Patient cells in this model preserved key properties and successfully replicated clinical phenotypes in the model. Promising therapeutic targets were identified through chemogenomic screening. To address resistance to single-target inhibition, potential combination targets were predicted using AI tools enhanced with target-based knowledge graphs (KG) and active learning algorithms. The top 20 combination targets were selected and tested, resulting in promising combination hits that demonstrated significant efficacy for this challenging and heterogeneous disease. The integration of AI-assisted combination discovery with the patient-like disease model has uncovered new opportunities for developing novel therapies and combination treatments.Methods:For the vascularized GC model, patient cells, isolated from surgical specimens or ascitic fluid, were expanded and formed into spheroids. These spheroids were co-cultured with Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) in Curiochips by embedding them in a hydrogel. The chemogenomic library was developed based on pathway analyses of RNAseq and proteomics studies of advanced gastric cancer. Additionally, the combination library was designed by the process utilized AI for image feature extraction, supplemented by a target-based knowledge graph (KG) that integrated data from over 20 public databases, encompassing genomics, proteomics, drug interactions, and pathway information. All screens were performed using high-throughput screening (HTS) instruments, including high-content confocal microscopy, leveraging the HTS compatibility of Curiochips.Results:Metastatic GC patient samples exhibited clinical phenotypes of aggressive migration and angiogenesis when co-cultured with endothelial cells in 3D. From pathway analysis, 200 targets were identified, and their inhibitors were screened in the vascularized model. The top targets were prioritized based on image analysis of GC phenotypic landscape. Among these, PKMYT1 was selected as a test case for identifying potential combination targets. Using the target-based KG, 20 top targets for combination with the PKMYT1 inhibitor were identified and screened in the disease model. The combination demonstrated promising efficacy and significantly delayed the onset of drug resistance.Citation Format:Yeongmin Choi, Sumin Kim, Yangji Kim, Youngsook Song, Jinhwan Jang, Delaney Donnelly, Bushra Rajput, Tsung-Li Liu, Kyusuk Baek, Aneesh Sathe, Sanghee Yoo.

    "abstract": "Background:Peritoneal metastasis is the result of direct shedding of tumor cells from ovarian, colorectal, and other cancers that lead to studding and growth on the peritoneal surfaces and abdominal organs. Standard chemotherapy and surgery can transiently improve symptoms, but long-term disease control and survival extension remain rare due to residual disease and treatment resistance. In the past 40 years, tremendous progress in photoimmunotherapy (PIT) has been made to treat metastasis. However, many are lost in translation due to heterogeneity in photosensitizer drug uptake and treatment response. Thus, we hypothesize that the delivery of targeted therapies with a multimodal approach for PIT and integrates well with current standards of care strategies can help overcome heterogeneous delivery and improved treatment efficacy. Our novel targeted photoactivable multi-agent liposome (TPMAL) combined with fluorescence-guided PIT was demonstrated in this newly reported study.Methods:TPMAL consists of antibody drug conjugates (photosensitizer drug and anti-EGFR antibody) conjugated onto active-loaded liposomal surface. Female athymic nude mice (18-20 g and 4-6 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 3 x 107 OVCAR-5 human ovarian cancer cells suspended in 2 mL of PBS. Post tumor implantation, mice were i.p. injected with TPMAL or ADC alone on Day 10. Post 24h, tumor nodules were collected and frozen with Tissue-Tek O.C.T compound at -80\u00b0C until slicing. Fluorescence and bright field imaging of whole tumor nodule slices were performed with a Lionheart\u2122 FX Automated Microscope. The center of each tumor nodule was selected for further image analysis using ImageJ. Lastly, intraperitoneal fluorescence-guided light delivery PIT with TPMAL was performed using the ML7710 medial laser device and Modulight cloud software for survival studies.Results:TPMAL active-loaded formulation demonstrated batch-to-batch consistency and stability was observed for up to one year. This formulation also demonstrated enhanced photosensitizer drug delivery into peritoneal tumor nodules by 1.6X and up to 616.4 \u03bcm penetration depth compared to antibody drug conjugates alone. TPMAL FGLD PIT combination therapy with adjuvant chemotherapy also demonstrated enhanced long-term survival by 240X compared to no treatment and chemotherapy alone groups.Conclusions:Our novel targeted photoactivable multi-agent liposome (TPMAL) combined with fluorescence-guided PIT was investigated for its translational potential and therapeutic efficacy by (1) developing an active-loaded liposomal formulation, (2) studying tumor nodule penetration depth of TPMAL, (3) understanding tissue optical property via oxygenation and how it may affect PIT using the ML7710, and (4) enhancing long term therapeutic efficacy compared to monotherapy treated groups in a mouse peritoneal carcinomatosis model.Citation Format:Sumiao Pang, Carla Arnau Del Valle, Robert Perttila, Nada Fadul, Dana Roque, Tayyaba Hasan, Petteri Uusimaa, Huang Chiao` Huang.

    "abstract": "Heterobifunctional small molecules recruiting the proteasomal machinery enable the targeted protein degradation (TPD) of selected proteins and considerably broaden the druggable space for therapeutic use. Many such molecules have seen fantastic success in preclinical and clinical developments, e.g., for targeted degradation of specific oncoproteins that were previously inaccessible for cancer therapy. Even though early hits are quickly generated by adapting the modular concept of bifunctional degraders, most of such molecules are against the central rules of a \u201cdrug-like\u201d molecule: they are usually larger in size (800-1500 Da) and often lack sufficient solubility. These early bifunctional degraders hits require exhaustive structure optimization in each case to optimize pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles and bioavailability.Here, we report Tubulis\u2019 antibody-degrader conjugates that exploit bifunctional degraders as high-potency bioactive payloads to be released specifically inside cells that are targeted by the antibody. Our linker technology ensures high degrader-to-antibody ratios (DARs) and excellent linker stability in blood plasma. Moreover, we liberate the degrader after receptor-mediated uptake of the ADC and show high efficiencies in target protein degradation. Most importantly, our conjugates exhibit antibody-like PK properties that ensure long-lasting plasma circulation of high DAR constructs over weeks, even when bifunctional degraders are employed that have not been optimized for PK properties. Taken together, these factors allow impressive in vivo efficacy of the conjugates after single dose application in preclinical animal models.Citation Format:Jan G. Felber, Anil P.

    "abstract": "Background:Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer subtype and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Advances in treatment have focused on personalized approaches that use targeted therapies and immunotherapies based on protein, DNA, or RNA biomarkers. Assessing molecular biomarkers typically takes 1-2 weeks with challenges such as tissue exhaustion and poor response prediction. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows for point-of care evaluation of nanomechanical signatures (NS) in hours, offering a fast and accurate method for diagnosis and treatment personalization.Methods:We used the AFM-based Automated and Reliable Tissue Diagnostics (ARTIDIS) platform to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of NS. Fresh tumor and paired uninvolved pulmonary tissue samples were collected from 70 early-stage NSCLC patients who underwent curative surgical procedures at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. Measurements were blinded, and samples were preserved in formalin for further histopathological and molecular analyses.Results:In this proof-of-concept study, ARTIDIS NS successfully distinguished malignant tumors from uninvolved pulmonary tissue with 88% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 87% accuracy (n=52). The NS also accurately identified histological subtypes, including adenocarcinoma (ADC, 100% sensitivity) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, 83% specificity). ARTIDIS NS identified aggressive features predictive of early recurrence in non-involved samples (82% sensitivity, 72% specificity). Out of 70 patients, 17 had recurrences (median time: 7.7 months), leading to 12 deaths, 10 due to cancer. Remarkably, ARTIDIS NS accurately predicted tumor progression within 10 months post-surgery, achieving 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity in identifying patients at risk of recurrence after curative treatment.Conclusions:The findings suggest that ARTIDIS NS is a rapid and reliable tool for predicting recurrence and assessing outcomes in NSCLC while preserving tissues for downstream assessment. The ARTIDIS platform not only demonstrated significant accuracy in differentiating malignant tissues, but also showed exceptional precision in predicting early recurrence and progression, effectively identifying high-risk patients.

    "abstract": "Introduction:BCMA CAR-T cell therapies have demonstrated superior efficacy, including in patients with extramedullary disease and high-risk cytogenetics, compared to BCMA-directed TCE or ADC. The longitudinal single cell analysis revealed that pre-existing T cell exhaustion and presence of highly proliferative plasma cells with Ag downregulation predisposed to early relapse post BCMA CAR-T. Moreover, shedding BCMA and suppressive TME also pose significant challenges for sustained clinical response. To tackle these obstacles, BCMA and GPRC5D bi-specific CAR-Ts were designed. GPRC5D is a promising therapeutic target for multiple myeloma (MM), as it - expresses exclusively on MM cells but not in normal tissues (except for hair follicles) and is independent of BCMA expression. Clinical studies confirmed the co-existence of single or double Ag positive MM subsets within the same patient, along with a rare occurrence of double-negative multiple myeloma plasma cells.Methods:Aiming to broadly and deeply eradicate MM subsets and achieve long-term remission, we\u2019ve developed bi-specific CAR-Ts exclusively targeting BCMA and GPRC5D. Our design incorporates novel VHH binders with optimized CAR design to enhance sensitivity and efficacy toward heterogenous MM cells in the presence of soluble BCMA, mitigate Ag escape, restore T cell functionality and improve expansion. We\u2019ve conducted the pre-clinical investigations to validate the activity, functionality and druggability of the bi-specific CAR-Ts.Results:Binding to GPRC5D and BCMA resulted in bi-specific CAR-T exhibiting improved immune cell activation, superior anti-tumor activity, and functionality over mono-CAR-T or benchmark, and enhanced target-dependent expansion under re-stress. Moreover, the bi-specific CAR-T retained its functionality against BCMA.KO or GPRC5D.KO cells, whereas the mono-CAR-T could not. Importantly, the optimized bi-specific CAR designs incorporating the novel BCMA VHH binder(s) showed robust cytotoxicity against MM cells with low Ag expression in the presence of high concentrations of soluble BCMA, suggesting their potential to effectively counteract the inhibitory effects of soluble BCMA in the serum of MM patients. Compared to mono-specific CAR-Ts, the bi-specific CAR-T showed robust efficacy in tumor eradication at low dose(s) in NSG mice xenografted with heterogeneous MM cell lines.Conclusions:The pre-clinical data of GPRC5D and BCMA bi-specific CAR-T exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy and persistence, mitigated Ag escape and preserved potency with shedding BCMA. Our findings provide support for the clinical investigation of the bi-specific CAR-T as a therapeutic approach to broadly and deeply deplete heterogenetic MM cell clones and subsets, potentially leading to durable responses in both newly diagnosed and R/R MM patients.Citation Format:Jincai Zhou, Xinran Luo, Kai Wu, Feifei Shi, Bixia Lei, Yanhong Xu, Joy Zhou, Xiaowen He.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Mutations in the gene for human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) result in constitutive phosphorylation of the protein and are driver alterations in cancer. HER2 mutations are present at a frequency of 1% to 4% in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with exon-20 insertion mutations such as A775_G776insYVMA and G776delinsVC being among the most common of these latter mutations. Although HER2-targeted ADCs have shown marked efficacy for HER2 mutation-positive NSCLC, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying such efficacy are not well understood.Methods:The intracellular trafficking and dimerization patterns of HER2 were examined in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of the protein with the use of live cell imaging and an in situ proximity ligation assay, respectively. Proteins that preferentially associate with mutant HER2 were identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to shed light on the pathway of HER2 trafficking in HER2-mutated cells.Results:HER2 internalization was enhanced in NSCLC cells expressing mutant forms of HER2 compared with those expressing HER2(WT). Homodimers of HER2(WT) were localized mainly at the cell surface, whereas those of mutant HER2 were present mostly in the cytoplasm. Although siRNA interference of EGFR or HER3 effectively suppressed the HER2 internalization in cells stably expressing WT forms of HER2, such internalization was not affected in the cell lines expressing mutant forms of HER2. The enhanced internalization of mutant HER2 was mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, as was reflected by increased binding of the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to mutant HER2 and its consequent ubiquitination. Zongertinib, a HER2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, attenuated HER2 phosphorylation, the binding of c-Cbl to HER2, and HER2 internalization in HER2-mutated cells.Conclusions:Upregulation of HER2 phosphorylation promotes internalization of mutant forms of HER2 mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which may contribute to the efficacy of HER2-targeted ADCs in NSCLC positive for HER2 mutations.Citation Format:Atsushi Shimauchi, Eiji Iwama, Ritsu Ibusuki, Hirono Tsutsumi, Daisuke Shibahara, Kohei Otsubo, Yasuto Yoneshima, Kentaro Tanaka, Hiroyuki Inoue, Isamu Okamoto.

    "abstract": "MFI2, also known as CD228, melanotransferrin, p97, MTf, or MELTF, is a GPI-anchored membrane protein that belongs to the iron-transporting transferrin family. CD228 expression is elevated in multiple solid tumors such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but has limited expression in normal tissues. Here, we have expanded our expression analysis and found that other solid tumors, including head and neck cancer (HNSCC) and esophageal cancer (ESCC), also show positivity rates of 86% and 94%, respectively. PF-08046031 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of the anti-CD228 human IgG1 antibody conjugated with an average of 4 molecules of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) by a cleavable valine-citrine (vc) linker. The proposed mechanism of action (MoA) of PF-08046031 is to bind to CD228-expressing cells where it is internalized and transported to lysosomes to release MMAE, causing microtubule disruption and cytotoxic cell death. This drug-linker and conjugation methodology have been clinically validated and approved. In this study, pharmacological evaluations of antibody binding, internalization, cytotoxic cell death and in vivo anti-tumor activity were conducted using various in vitro and in vivo models. PF-08046031 specifically binds to human CD228 with high affinity in both high and low CD228-expressing tumor cells. In vitro studies showed that the ADC had strong cytotoxic effects on CD228-positive cell lines but not on CD228 negative or genetically modified CD228KO cells. The anti-tumor activity of PF-08046031 was tested in vivo using two cutaneous melanoma models derived from cell lines (A2058 and Colo853). After a single intravenous dose of PF-08046031 at 3 and 6 mg/kg, significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was observed in a dose-dependent manner compared to the untreated group. At the highest dose of 6.0 mg/kg, TGI reached 87% for A2058-derived tumors and 90% for COLO853-derived tumors. These findings support the clinical development of PF-08046031 for targeting multiple solid tumors.Citation Format:Raj Giraddi, Steven Jin, Devra J.

    "abstract": "Cancer treatment has been facing many hurdles, drug resistance is one of the most significant one among them. Over the years, treatment strategies have been evolving. A complex interaction between intrinsic (innate) and extrinsic (acquired) factors enables the survival of selected cancer cells, through progression under unfavorable conditions, ultimately develop resistance. Although numerous prospective drugs against cancer have been shown promising therapeutic efficacy on preclinical in vitro and in vivo models, only a few have been proven safe and effective in clinical validations. These problems are largely due to the lack of precise research tools to reveal the genuine status of cancer especially to recapitulate cancer resistance development in real-world patients. Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models have been shown superiority in reflecting the characteristics of cancer patients by retaining genomic information, diversified treatment backgrounds and clinical behaviors, all of these features make PDX an excellent in vivo system to study drug resistance, evaluate drug sensitivity and better treatment regimens. However, due to the low tumor engraftment rate and difficulty to reconstitute proper human immune system, only a few studies published about drug resistant humanized PDX model. The current study describes the successful establishment and validation of two drug-resistant humanized PDX models: a HER2 ADC resistant gastric PDX demonstrating clear innate resistance, and a multidrug resistant (MDR) melanoma PDX showing acquired resistance to targeted therapies, immune check point inhibitors (ICIs) and ionizing radiation. The gastric PDX model with HER2 expression confirmed by IHC (2+) shown limited response (TGI <10%) to trastuzumab deruxtecan and no response to Dxd, demonstrating a clear intrinsic resistance. In a separate study in hPBMC mice, significant tumor growth inhibition was achieved (TGI > 60%) when treating with anti-hPD1, implicating the clinical benefit of combining ICIs with ADC treatments. The MDR melanoma PDX model was derived from a patient with treatment history of initial surgical resections, followed by targeted therapies (VEM+COB) then ICIs when recurrence happened. The tumor shown limited response to BRAF inhibitor (TGI <15%) and completely abolished response to anti-hPDL1, anti-hPD1 and ionizing radiation in humanized mice with averaged hCD45% > 30%. We have successfully established and characterized several drug resistant PDX models particularly in humanized mice, making it possible to study interactions between human tumors and immune system, identify biomarkers and better clinical strategies to overcome drug resistance. This platform can be used to achieve personalized medication management, which is the ultimate translational goal.Citation Format:Jie Wen, Hao Cheng, Cheng Zhang, Bingrui Han.

    "abstract": "Introduction:While radical cystectomy (RC) following neoadjuvant therapy remains the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), bladder-preserving treatments offer a viable option for selected patients to improve quality of life. Rapid detection of therapeutic response is critical for clinical decision-making but remains challenging. Here, we introduce a non-invasive liquid biopsy assay based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) to monitor the molecular response in both urine and blood during neoadjuvant therapy in MIBC patients.Methods:This ongoing trial has enrolled 20 patients treated with HER2 ADC neoadjuvant therapy, followed by radiotherapy and clinical evaluation to decide between RC or bladder preservation. In a completed pilot cohort of seven patients, both urine and blood samples were collected before and after HER2 ADC treatment to evaluate therapy response. The study utilized PredicineCARE, a targeted NGS assay, to analyze circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in urine and blood samples, aiming to detect genetic variations and evaluate tumor fractions in patients.Results:In the pilot cohort of seven patients, the ctDNA assay detected a greater number of somatic mutations and exhibited higher detection positivity in urine samples compared to blood samples. Specifically, in urine samples, the assay identified 138 somatic mutations at baseline and 18 mutations at the end of therapy, achieving positivity in all seven patients at both time points. In contrast, in blood samples, it identified 11 mutations at baseline and 6 mutations at the end of therapy, with positivity in 5 out of 7 and 4 out of 7 patients, respectively. The overall tumor fractions detected in urine samples were significantly higher at baseline than at the end of therapy (median tumor fraction: baseline 10.6% vs. end of therapy 0.8%; p=0.043), a trend not observed in blood samples. Moreover, through paired comparisons of each patient's urine samples at the two time points, we observed a molecular response\u2014defined as a tumor fraction decrease greater than 20%\u2014in six of the seven patients, and molecular progression\u2014defined as a tumor fraction increase greater than 20%\u2014in one patient. These findings were consistent with the clinical evaluations conducted at baseline and at the end of therapy.Conclusion:Our study demonstrates that urine-based ctDNA analysis using a non-invasive liquid biopsy assay provides a reliable method for monitoring molecular response during neoadjuvant therapy in patients with MIBC undergoing bladder-preserving treatments. These findings suggest that urine ctDNA analysis can serve as a valuable tool for rapid detection of therapeutic response, aiding clinical decision-making. Further validation in larger cohorts is warranted to establish its utility in routine clinical practice.Citation Format:Jiani Deng, Feng Wen, Haoran Tang, Cancan Jia, Yue Zhang, Peng Zhang, Yali Shen.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) representing a highly aggressive subtype. The prognosis for SCLC remains dire due to early metastasis, chemoresistance, high recurrence rates, and limited therapeutic options. Despite the approval of some immunotherapeutic drugs for SCLC, their efficacy is restricted to a small subset of patients. This limited success is attributed to low expression of PD-L1 and the immune-cold tumor microenvironment in SCLC, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic targets. Bioinformatic analysis of SCLC datasets, focusing on immune checkpoint regulators, identified B7H3 (CD276) as a promising candidate upregulated in SCLC. This finding was confirmed in SCLC cell lines and human tissue samples. B7H3 is a cell surface protein overexpressed in multiple tumor types, functioning as both an immune modulator and an oncogenic driver. However, its role in SCLC tumorigenesis remains unclear. To investigate the functional involvement of B7H3 in SCLC, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out the B7H3 gene in SCLC cell lines. B7H3 knockout significantly reduced transwell migration and wound-healing abilities in SCLC cells. When co-cultured with T-cells, B7H3-proficient SCLC cells suppressed T cell activation, unlike their B7H3-deficient counterparts. To therapeutically target B7H3, we used the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) m276-SL-PBD in the spontaneous SCLC mouse model RPM (Adeno-CGRP-Cre; Rb1flox/flox; TP53flox/flox; LSL-MycT58A) which significantly reduced tumor burden, metastasis, angiogenesis, and increased T cell infiltration. To further elucidate the role of B7H3 in SCLC progression, we generated a novel spontaneous mouse model, RPMC (Adeno-CGRP-Cre; Rb1flox/flox; TP53flox/flox; LSL-MycT58A; Cd276fl/fl). These mice exhibited a marked decrease in tumor burden, tumor-associated angiogenesis, and metastasis, with a significantly increased T-cell infiltration compared to controls. Transcriptomic analysis of B7H3-proficient/-deficient cells revealed NFIB among the top 50 downregulated genes following B7H3 deletion. NFIB, a key driver of SCLC metastasis, was significantly reduced in B7H3-deficient human and syngeneic (RPMC) cell lines. Metastatic tissues from RPMC mice also showed lower NFIB expression compared to the RPM model. In conclusion, this study highlights the critical role of B7H3 as well as modulation of NFIB expression in regulating SCLC progression. Our findings establish B7H3 as a promising therapeutic target and demonstrate the potential role of CD276 ADCs in overcoming the limitations of current treatments of SCLC. By advancing our understanding of B7H3\u2019s role in promoting tumor growth, this study paves the way for designing more effective therapeutic strategies to combat SCLC.Citation Format:Mahek Fatima, Parvez Khan, Md Arafat Khan, Asad Ur Rehman, Laiba Anwar, Aatiya Ahmad, Jaewon Lee, Imayavaramban Lakshmanan, Anish Thomas, Dinesh Pradhan, Apar K.

    "abstract": "Peptide-drug-conjugates (PDCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) in oncology. PDCs, with their smaller size (<10 kDa), can offer improved tumor penetration. Additionally, PDCs can potentially exhibit a better safety profile due to their shorter blood PK, absence of an Fc domain, and reduced immunogenicity. Furthermore, PDCs can be entirely chemically synthesized, providing a homogeneous chemical entity. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a key target that is overexpressed in many tumor types. Current EGFR inhibitors primarily focus on mutant forms, creating a treatment gap for tumors with only wild-type overexpression. Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) represents another cancer-specific marker that supports tumor survival in hypoxic or acidic conditions and is frequently co-overexpressed with EGFR in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck cancers, and pancreatic cancers. SYNB011128, a bispecific PDC, exhibits high affinity and specificity for binding both EGFR and CAIX. Upon internalization, SYNB011128 releases MMAE, a potent tubulin inhibitor, through linker cleavage by tumor-specific proteases. In total, SYNB011128 employs three primary anti-cancer mechanisms: 1) Competing with EGF to inhibit the EGFR pathway. 2) Inhibiting CAIX enzyme function, crucial for cancer cell survival in hypoxic environments and resistance clone development. 3) Delivering the cytotoxic MMAE payload. Preclinical studies showed that SYNB011128 achieved complete tumor regression in multiple pancreatic and colon cancer models, outperforming EGFR-antibody-drug conjugates (EGFR-ADCs). Additionally, SYNB011128 showed efficacy in models of Osimertinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With a molecular weight of 4 kDa, SYNB011128 exhibited rapid and deep tumor penetration. PDC induced biomarker was detected in both the periphery and core of the tumor within 6 hours post-dosing. Despite its relatively short blood half-life, SYNB011128 ensured sustained accumulation of the payload within tumors. This pharmacokinetic profile may reduce on-target toxicity and enhance safety. In mouse studies, SYNB011128 demonstrated no adverse effects, such as weight loss or liver/kidney damage, after 28 days of treatment at doses that induced tumor regression. Chemically, SYNB011128 is synthesized as a single enantiomer, without diastereomeric isomers. In summary, PDC SYNB011128 effectively targets both EGFR and CAIX, utilizing multiple anti-cancer mechanisms and achieving deep tumor penetration, which may lead to robust clinical efficacy. By binding to two cancer antigens to enhance tumor selectivity over normal tissues, and a pharmacokinetic profile of sustained tumor accumulation vs a short blood half-life, SYNB011128 may also have an improved safety margin.Citation Format:Caihong Zhou, Michael Poss, Cheng Lu, Ruochi Zhang, Yu Wang, Yuanpeng Xiong, Xin Gao, Xiao Zhang, Yan Degenhardt.

    "abstract": "Treatment options for HER2 positive cancer types have advanced significantly over recent years, focusing on targeted therapies that inhibit HER2 signaling and more recently using HER2 as the anchor-signal to bring tumor killing moieties or effector immune cells near the cancer cell. In our recent study we compared in vivo efficacy in tumor bearing immune-compromised mice using four different modalities in a proof-of-concept format in a HER2+ ovarian cancer xenograft model, SKOV-3. We then tested a panel of HER2 targeting agents in a broader range of clinically relevant PDX models of breast, ovarian and gastric cancer and correlated these results with different characteristics of the PDX models, such as HER2 expression (by IHC) and molecular phenotype (by WES and RNAseq). The range of modalities that were tested in this study comprised small molecules, antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and mRNA-LNP encoded antibodies. Antitumoral activity was measured as tumor growth inhibition (TGI) based on twice weekly tumor volume measurements. The sensitivity of SKOV-3 was heavily influenced by the modality of the respective drug. Whereas small molecule Lapatinib showed only mild efficacy (TGI 40%), Trastuzumab was moderately active (TGI 57%) compared to Trastuzumab-emtansine (TGI 68%). An mRNA-LNP encoding for trastuzumab was the most efficacious treatment with a TGI of 88%. Despite this, none of the treatments induced complete remission. The ongoing analysis of tumor tissue from these studies suggests an escape mechanism via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as Vimentin is upregulated and E-Cadherin is downregulated in tumors after re-growth. The superior activity of the mRNA-encoded trastuzumab compared to the clinically approved therapeutic is likely to be due to the elevated and sustained trastuzumab protein levels in the serum of the tumor bearing animals. Broader screening across 33 PDX models revealed ADCs (trastuzumab-emtansin and trastuzumab-deruxtan) as the most efficacious modalities leading to higher TGI values with prolonged persistence of tumor remission. Two therapeutic antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) showed similar activity patterns despite their slightly different modes of action. HER2 expression correlated with the sensitivity of the PDX model, although this relationship was not strictly linear. HER2 has provided oncologists a tractable target for some cancer types. However, clinical as well as preclinical data indicate the further untapped potential of HER2 as a therapeutic target. Screening studies like those described are important tools to deconvolute sensitivity and possible mechanisms of resistance in a preclinical setting. This provides opportunities to discover biomarkers to better enable patient selection and to provide a better understanding of HER2 biology, further maximizing its therapeutic potential.Citation Format:Eva Oswald, Philipp Meyer, Loreen Weichert, Roxana Redis, Dan Rocca, Louise Brackenbury, Justin Bryans, Julia B.

    "abstract": "As a novel immune checkpoint, we previously confirmed that contactin 4 (CNTN4) expressed on tumors negatively regulates T cell activity by binding to amyloid precursor protein (APP) on T cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed high expression of CNTN4 in various tumors, including gallbladder, pancreatic, gastric, endometrial, hepatic, prostatic, bladder cancers, melanoma, and others, while its expression remains low in normal tissues, including immune cells. Based on the tumor-specific expression profile of CNTN4, we have developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting CNTN4. This ADC utilizes GENA-104A16.hIgG1 (A16.1), an anti-CNTN4 antibody with reduced effector function of human IgG1, conjugated via cysteine-maleimide linkage to linker including hydrophilic moiety and the topoisomerase I inhibitor (exatecan) with high drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR)(A16.1-Exa). To evaluate its potential, the internalization performance of A16.1 was compared with trastuzumab (anti-HER2) using SK-BR3 cells engineered to overexpress CNTN4, which exhibited a higher HER2 target count than CNTN4 target count. A16.1-Exa demonstrated potent and highly specific cytotoxicity in CNTN4-positive cancer cells, accompanied by a robust bystander effect comparable to the Dxd conjugate. Additionally, A16.1-Exa exhibited high plasma stability and retained its immune checkpoint-blocking function, supporting T cell-mediated cytotoxicity alongside payload delivery. Treatment with A16.1-Exa demonstrated a very promising anti-tumor effect in a fibrosarcoma xenograft mouse model (HT1080/CNTN4). Investigation of the anti-tumor efficacy in a PDX model was conducted with GENA-104A16 (human IgG4 S228P) antibody in the IND-approved stage, conjugated with MMAF (low DAR) in a pancreatic cancer model. Once the tumor volume reached 195 mm3, mice were randomly divided, and the A16-MMAF conjugate (5 mg/kg) was administered intravenously twice post-grouping. The treatment showed strong anti-tumor activity, leading to tumor regression. Future studies will expand the PDX models and optimize the therapeutic potential of exatecan conjugates to advance the development of CNTN4-targeted therapies, offering a promising approach for treating diverse cancers.Citation Format:Mi Young Cha, Mira Kim, Seungmin Byun, Youngeun Ha, Kitae Park, Bu-Nam Jeon, Hyunuk Kim, Hyunkyung Yu, Hyunjin Yoo, Soojung Moon, Gyeong-Jin Cheon, Boeun Ju, Hansoo Park.

    "abstract": "Nectin-4-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) linked with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for metastatic bladder cancer. In combination with pembrolizumab, this therapy has doubled overall survival compared to conventional platinum-based chemotherapy. However, challenges such as drug toxicity and the accumulation of resistance to MMAE limit its therapeutic potential. In this study, we introduce a novel Nectin-4-targeted gene therapy strategy employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This advanced gene-editing tool, known for its precise induction of double-strand DNA breaks, was adapted to create over 50 random double-strand breaks (referred to as MT50) in target cells, leading to apoptotic cell death. To address the critical challenge of delivering gene-editing tools efficiently and specifically to cancer cells, we developed a highly efficient nucleic acid encapsulation system with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle. This platform demonstrated high nucleic acid encapsulation efficiency, exceeding 60% for plasmids (\u223c1 kb) and 80% for shorter RNAs, such as siRNA. The system was further optimized for encapsulating CRISPR/Cas9 components, including guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 mRNA. The T24 bladder cancer cell line, characterized by high Nectin-4 expression, was used as the experimental model. In vitro experiments demonstrated that MT50 delivery via Nectin-4-conjugated PLGA nanoparticles inhibited cellular proliferation by over 70%. In vivo, the nanoparticles were administered systemically through intraperitoneal injection into a murine model bearing T24 bladder cancer tumors. Tumor volume decreased by 70% following MT50 treatment, with significant downregulation of Nectin-4 expression observed in treated tumors compared to controls. While this experiment was conducted in immunocompromised mice, precluding the assessment of immunogenic cell death or synergistic effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors, we anticipate enhanced anti-tumor efficacy in immunocompetent models. Specifically, combining MT50 treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is expected to amplify therapeutic outcomes. This study highlights the successful development of a Nectin-4-targeted PLGA nanoparticle system capable of efficiently encapsulating and delivering CRISPR/Cas9 components to bladder cancer cells. The MT50 delivery system demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, offering a promising alternative to MMAE-linked ADCs. By circumventing cumulative resistance and leveraging the precision of gene editing, this approach has the potential to redefine bladder cancer therapeutics.Citation Format:Seung-hwan Jeong, Seokbong Hong, Hyeong Dong Yuk, Cheol Kwak.

    "abstract": "Off-target toxicity has long been a dose-limiting factor for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and targeted radiopharmaceutical therapies (TRT). This fundamental limitation primarily arises due to the catabolic elimination process of both therapeutic modalities which exposes healthy tissues to cytotoxic agents. Pre-targeting offers a transformative solution to overcome these challenges as it separates the tumor-targeting and payload-delivery steps, thereby minimizing systemic exposure and maximizing on-target effects. Leveraging this concept, we present Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC\u00ae) technology as the ideal pre-targeting reunion platform.CAPAC uses in vivo click chemistry to selectively capture drug payloads at tumors with minimal systemic exposure, thus extending the therapeutic window of targeted therapies. CAPAC employs a two-component system: 1) a clickable binder infusion targeting a tumor antigen, and 2) a subsequent infusion of a clickable payload (\u201cprotodrug\u201d). These two components \u201cclick\u201d at tumors, enabling delivery of high therapeutic payload to the target while sparing normal tissues.We have generated proof-of-concept data on CAPAC using clickable binders against HER2, TROP2, and CEACAM5, which we paired with different clickable payloads, including a trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-modified biotin probe and a protodrug of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). We evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biodistribution across CDX models or in tumor-free mice.Payload capture was antigen-dependent and markedly higher in tumors vs plasma and normal tissues, with tumor levels exceeding systemic levels by more than 10-fold at 8.5 hours post-infusion. Tumor payload exposure was proportional with receptor density, as the HER2-binder captured more biotin than the TROP2-binder. Slower antigen internalization (HER2, CEACAM5) extended the duration of payload exposure in tumor vs plasma compared to faster internalization (TROP2). These PK and biodistribution results validate the highly selective tumor targeting of CAPAC. Importantly, enhanced tumor payload exposure translated into significant anti-tumor efficacy with the MMAE protodrug, which achieved dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition across various CDX models. These findings underscore CAPAC\u2019s potential to overcome the limitations of off-target toxicities and extend the applicability of cytotoxic agents to poorly internalizing targets.Our preclinical data confirm in vivo click chemistry as a powerful pre-targeting reunion technology, offering modularity to accommodate various antigen targets and payloads. By delivering targeted therapies with unprecedented precision, CAPAC fulfills Paul Erlich\u2019s vision of a truly targeted delivery system. CAPAC opens new avenues for safer and more effective cancer treatments, addressing needs are yet unmet by ADCs and TRTs.Citation Format:Travis L.

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) bind to their receptors (fibroblast growth factor receptors, FGFRs), activating downstream signaling pathways, which play crucial roles in both mitogenic processes, such as embryogenesis and growth, and non-mitogenic processes, such as neuroregulation and metabolic regulation. FGFRs primarily consist of four subtypes: FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. Abnormalities like high expression or mutations in these receptors can lead to the aberrant activation of their signaling pathways, resulting in tumorigenesis. Consequently, targeting FGFR is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Current FGFR-targeting drugs, either in clinical use or under development, include small molecule inhibitors, antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), CAR-T therapies, and soluble FGFR receptors. Different cell models are required for efficacy evaluation of various drug types. Kyinno has developed a comprehensive series of FGFR-related cell lines, which include Ba/F3 kinase cells, FGFR overexpression cells, knockout cells, and reporter cells. Among these, Ba/F3 cells have been meticulously engineered to depend on various FGFR point mutations and fusion mutations for survival, showcasing robust capabilities in evaluating FGFR small molecule inhibitors. The FGFR overexpression and knockout cells are crucial for assessing antibody binding, ADC drug endocytosis, and certain radioimmuno conjugates (RICs). Reporter cells, designed based on FGFR downstream signaling pathways, cover a spectrum of wild-type and point-mutated FGFR subtypes, thus effectively evaluating the impact of drugs on downstream signaling pathways. This strategic array of cell models collectively enhances the development and validation of FGFR-targeted therapies, providing invaluable insights and tools for advancing cancer treatment research. By leveraging these diverse cell models, researchers can better understand the mechanisms of FGFR-targeted interventions, ultimately contributing to more effective therapeutic strategies.Citation Format:Siyu Li, Yao Peng, Yu Wang, Maimaitiming Nuermanguli, Jinying Ning, Feng Hao.

    "abstract": "EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are standard clinical treatment for NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations. However, both intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs limited their long-term efficacy, posing a significant unmet medical need. The protein overexpression of c-MET has been observed in 5-22% of EGFR-TKIs resistant NSCLC patients. Therefore, a bispecific ADC targeting EGFR and c-MET will shed a light on the management for EGFR-TKI resistance. E-cM-Topi is an EGFR and cMET bispecific ADC, consisting of a Fc-silenced EGFR-cMET bispecific antibody, a cleavable linker and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload (Topi) with superior bystander effect. The binding affinities to EGFR and c-MET were optimized to enhance tumor-cell-selectivity, increase endocytosis, and improve pharmacokinetics (PK). Considering the wide expression of EGFR in normal tissue, the binding affinity to EGFR was adjusted to be weaker than that to c-MET, thereby enhancing the selectivity for EGFR-cMET-co-expressing tumors while minimizing the toxicity on normal tissues. E-cM-Topi demonstrated strong EGFR/cMET-dependent growth inhibition in various NSCLC cell lines. In HCC827 and EBC-1 xenograft models, E-cM-Topi inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Tumor regression was observed at a single dose of 4.5 mg/kg and sustained till day 35 in HCC827 model and day 20 in EBC-1 model. In addition, E-cM-Topi showed good human plasma stability and favorable cyno PK profile. Less than 0.5% of payload was released in human plasma after a 14-day incubation. Half-life of E-cM-Topi was more than 3 days in cyno monkey. In summary, by fine-tuning the EGFR-cMET bispecific antibody affinity and incorporating a superior bystander effect of payload, E-cM-Topi represents a best-in-class potential. It holds promise as an effective treatment option for EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC patients.Citation Format:Huihui Chen, Le Sun, Bing Hu, Zhiping Zhao, Ziheng Liu, Guangbao Qiu, Dongmei Bai, Ying Li, Ziwei Ren, Ting Zhang, Xin Ye, Lingfeng You, Zhendong Xue, Yuchang Mao, Huaixin Dang, Shuyu Cai, Jun Feng, Min Hu, Feng He.

    "abstract": "Tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) are short oligosaccharides that are often overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. They are derived from changes in glycosylation pathways associated with malignancy, which lead to overproduced or aberrant structures, and represent a still unexplored target class for cancer therapy. We focus on the generation of antibodies against these specific and difficult antigens and were able to obtain two high-affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), TCX-101 and TCX-201, against two distinct TACA structures that are highly expressed across a broad range of cancer indications. Both mAbs show superior affinity and specificity to their target compared to previously generated ones, as assessed by glycan array, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. By investigating the characteristics of our glycan targets, we explored different modes of action to tailor the most effective treatment. Previously, our team has shown that TCX-101 can be effectively used as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which showed encouraging results in vivo against breast and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In addition, we here present TCX-101 in a bispecific T-cell engager (TcE) format, showing efficient in vitro T-cell activation and killing of cancer cells from different indications endogenously expressing low (SW837), medium (LoVo) to high levels (MCF7) of our TACA target already at an effector:target ratio of 4:1 with antibody concentrations in the pico- to low nanomolar concentration range, i.e. IC50 of 9 nM (SW837), 0.13 nM (LoVo) and 0.0078 nM (MCF7), respectively. In vivo evaluation of this TcE is currently investigated using cell-line derived xenograft models in humanized mice. TCX-201, targeting a different TACA, is currently being evaluated as an ADC with two different payloads, monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE) and Exatecan (XTC). In vitro studies show effective killing of various pancreatic (e.g. high expressing HuP-T4 cells with an IC50 for MMAE payload of 0.3 nM) and colon cancer cell lines expressing different levels of the target (e.g. Colo-205 (high expressing) with an IC50 of 0.013 nM or LS180 (medium expressing) with an IC50 of 4.7 nM), and high efficacy for both payloads in a xenograft mouse model using HuP-T4 pancreatic cancer cells. In conclusion, our antibodies against TACAs represent new promising treatment options for different cancer indications and can be effectively employed with different modes of action, depending on the target characteristics.Citation Format:Francesco Muraca, Wiebke Winkler, Gustavo M.S.G.

    "abstract": "The advancements in biotechnology and the successful application of monoclonal antibody therapeutics have incited the development of innovative therapeutic antibody modalities, including bi-or tri-specific antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g. Fab), and other formats (e.g. DARPin). These have transformed cancer treatments; however, monoclonal antibodies often demonstrate limited efficacy in cancer therapy due to poor tumor penetration, leaving regions of untargeted and untreated tumor areas that can escape therapy. Addressing this limitation requires the development of advanced in vitro culture models that accurately replicate tumor-tumor microenvironment (TME) interactions. To bridge the gap between traditional 2D in vitro cultures and animal models, 3D human tumor spheroids offer a promising solution. In this context, InSphero has developed an in vitro 3D Antibody Penetration Assay. We demonstrate that 3D InSight\u2122 Human Tumor Microtissues closely mimic the complexity and heterogeneity of the TME, while maintaining uniform composition and size across spheroids, providing reliable and reproducible models to enhance drug discovery. Using 3D InSight\u2122 human tumor spheroids, we evaluated the efficacy, distribution, and penetration depth of a therapeutic antibody and an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). Results showed that both modalities successfully penetrated the 3D InSight\u2122 lung cancer tumor (A549) model. After 30 minutes of treatment, antibodies were detected at the periphery of the spheroids, while longer treatment windows resulted in progressively deeper penetration. This assay offers a robust and reliable platform for assessing the distribution and penetration of antibody therapeutics, biologics, ADCs, and other agents in solid tumor models, leveraging advanced in vitro 3D human tumor models to improve drug discovery and therapeutic development.Citation Format:Sue Fontaine Grepper, Maja Nedic, Charlotte Veser, Michal Rudnik, Matthias Zbinden, Irina Agarkova, Madhu Nag, Laure-Anne Ligeon.

    "abstract": "MFI2, also known as CD228, melanotransferrin, p97, MTf, or MELTF, is a GPI-anchored membrane protein that belongs to the iron-transporting transferrin family. CD228 expression is elevated in multiple solid tumors such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but has limited expression in normal tissues. Here, we have expanded our expression analysis and found that other solid tumors, including head and neck cancer (HNSCC) and esophageal cancer (ESCC), also show positivity rates of 86% and 94%, respectively. PF-08046031 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of the anti-CD228 human IgG1 antibody conjugated with an average of 4 molecules of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) by a cleavable valine-citrine (vc) linker. The proposed mechanism of action (MoA) of PF-08046031 is to bind to CD228-expressing cells where it is internalized and transported to lysosomes to release MMAE, causing microtubule disruption and cytotoxic cell death. This drug-linker and conjugation methodology have been clinically validated and approved. In this study, pharmacological evaluations of antibody binding, internalization, cytotoxic cell death and in vivo anti-tumor activity were conducted using various in vitro and in vivo models. PF-08046031 specifically binds to human CD228 with high affinity in both high and low CD228-expressing tumor cells. In vitro studies showed that the ADC had strong cytotoxic effects on CD228-positive cell lines but not on CD228 negative or genetically modified CD228KO cells. The anti-tumor activity of PF-08046031 was tested in vivo using two cutaneous melanoma models derived from cell lines (A2058 and Colo853). After a single intravenous dose of PF-08046031 at 3 and 6 mg/kg, significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was observed in a dose-dependent manner compared to the untreated group. At the highest dose of 6.0 mg/kg, TGI reached 87% for A2058-derived tumors and 90% for COLO853-derived tumors. These findings support the clinical development of PF-08046031 for targeting multiple solid tumors.Citation Format:Raj Giraddi, Steven Jin, Devra J.

    "abstract": "HER2 alterations such as amplification, overexpression, insertions, and point mutations, are established oncogenic drivers in many solid tumors. Activating HER2 mutations are found in 2-4% of advanced lung cancers and have emerged as mechanisms of acquired resistance to targeted therapies. Patients with HER2 mutant lung tumors develop more brain metastasis during treatment than patients with any other oncogenic drivers in lung cancer. Addressing brain metastasis in this group of patients remains a clinical challenge with limited therapeutic options. Approved HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors have inferior potency against key mutations and lack sufficient brain penetration to be an impactful treatment option for patients with brain metastasis. Herein, we describe advanced preclinical profiling of an EGFR-sparing, HER2 inhibitor clinical development candidate CGT4255 with potential best-in-class brain penetrance and potent activity across prevalent point mutations and exon 20 YVMA insertions. CGT4255 demonstrates robust efficacy in intracranial tumor growth inhibition studies and shows an additive effect on intracranial tumor shrinkage when combined with a HER2 ADC. Pre-clinical studies with the CGT4255 and T-DXd combination demonstrate enhancement of ADC internalization, thus highlighting a biological rationale for combination therapy.Citation Format:Mark J.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Mutations in the gene for human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) result in constitutive phosphorylation of the protein and are driver alterations in cancer. HER2 mutations are present at a frequency of 1% to 4% in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with exon-20 insertion mutations such as A775_G776insYVMA and G776delinsVC being among the most common of these latter mutations. Although HER2-targeted ADCs have shown marked efficacy for HER2 mutation-positive NSCLC, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying such efficacy are not well understood.Methods:The intracellular trafficking and dimerization patterns of HER2 were examined in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of the protein with the use of live cell imaging and an in situ proximity ligation assay, respectively. Proteins that preferentially associate with mutant HER2 were identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to shed light on the pathway of HER2 trafficking in HER2-mutated cells.Results:HER2 internalization was enhanced in NSCLC cells expressing mutant forms of HER2 compared with those expressing HER2(WT). Homodimers of HER2(WT) were localized mainly at the cell surface, whereas those of mutant HER2 were present mostly in the cytoplasm. Although siRNA interference of EGFR or HER3 effectively suppressed the HER2 internalization in cells stably expressing WT forms of HER2, such internalization was not affected in the cell lines expressing mutant forms of HER2. The enhanced internalization of mutant HER2 was mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, as was reflected by increased binding of the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to mutant HER2 and its consequent ubiquitination. Zongertinib, a HER2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, attenuated HER2 phosphorylation, the binding of c-Cbl to HER2, and HER2 internalization in HER2-mutated cells.Conclusions:Upregulation of HER2 phosphorylation promotes internalization of mutant forms of HER2 mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which may contribute to the efficacy of HER2-targeted ADCs in NSCLC positive for HER2 mutations.Citation Format:Atsushi Shimauchi, Eiji Iwama, Ritsu Ibusuki, Hirono Tsutsumi, Daisuke Shibahara, Kohei Otsubo, Yasuto Yoneshima, Kentaro Tanaka, Hiroyuki Inoue, Isamu Okamoto.

    "abstract": "Purpose:Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a key therapy for HER2+/HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (mBC), but up to 50% of patients develop resistance. Resistance mechanisms have implicated dysfunctions in DNA repair, lysosomal activity, and immune responses. This study combines spatial omics and quantum-inspired regulatory network analysis to investigate tumor-immune-extracellular matrix interactions contributing to T-DXd resistance.Methods:Using NanoString GeoMX, spatial proteomics were analyzed in 29 metastatic tissue sections from 15 responsive (R) and 14 non-responsive (NR) patients. Across 6-8 regions of interest per section, immune and stromal components were quantified. Additionally, a subset of samples (n = 2R, 2NR) underwent GeoMX whole transcriptomics profiling and analysis using both classical and quantum-inspired algorithms.Results:NR tumors consistently exhibited immunosuppression, disorganized immune responses, upregulated fibronectin, and poor infiltration of granzyme B-producing cells. Organ-specific findings included:\u2022NR bone and brain mets showed increased spatial correlations between dendritic cells and T-cell exhaustion markers (PD-L1, CTLA4), suggesting niches of immune suppression.\u2022NR bone mets showed increased spatial correlation of fibronectin correlated with immune markers, indicating that stiffer ECM physically blocks immune infiltration. \u2022R chest wall mets showed upregulated smooth muscle actin (SMA), possibly reflecting vascular remodeling and enhanced immune infiltration.Additionally, spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed the following::\u2022Tumor-associated B cells were identified in NR samples, interacting with exhausted T cells and the Wnt-catenin pathway. \u2022QuantumGRN revealed interactions in immune cells involving RBPP4 with DNMT3A and TAF4, linked to altered chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, respectively.Conclusions:This work shows that T-DXd response is heavily influenced by microenvironment remodeling and immune infiltration. This work highlights the value of spatial omics for uncovering ADC-resistance mechanisms, as well as the value of quantum-inspired computing for identifying novel therapeutic targets. In addition to collecting more spatial and single-cell omics data, future directionsinclude pathway validation in animal models and computationally simulating quantum and molecular dynamics of ADC resistance.Citation Format:Glori Das, Wenjuan Dong, Matthew Vasquez, Ji-hoon Lee, Yuan Gao, Jenny Chang, Xiaoxian Li, Hong Zhao, Stephen T.

    "abstract": "Background:Endometrial cancer (EC) represents a significant health burden globally, particularly in postmenopausal women. Current treatment options for advanced-stage EC remain limited, emphasizing the need for novel therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to investigate farletuzumab ecteribulin (FZEC), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1), as a potential new therapeutic agent for EC using tumor models. Methods:We utilized a panel of 24 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, representing various histological and molecular subtypes of EC with different levels of FR\u03b1 expression, to evaluate the antitumor effect of FZEC. FZEC was administered intravenously at doses of 5 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg. Intratumoral accumulation of eribulin, the payload of FZEC, was visualized using phosphor-integrated dot imaging. Results:FZEC demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor effects across the EC-PDX panel. At 5 mg/kg, the FZEC efficacy was associated with FR\u03b1 expression, with 100% of FR\u03b1 3+ models exhibiting tumor shrinkage compared to 27.2% of FR\u03b1-negative models. FZEC also demonstrated broad activity across both histological and molecular subtypes of EC. Intratumoral eribulin accumulation was highly correlated with antitumor effects, even in models with low FR\u03b1 expression. Follow-up studies confirmed FR\u03b1-dependent antitumor effects, while also indicating potential FR\u03b1-independent mechanisms of action. Conclusion:FZEC demonstrated robust antitumor effect against the FR\u03b1 high EC-PDX models. Importantly, significant antitumor effects were observed, even in FR\u03b1-low or negative models. Intratumoral eribulin accumulation exhibited a stronger correlation with efficacy than with FR\u03b1 expression alone. These results support further clinical development of FZEC for EC treatment and highlight the complexity of ADC mechanisms of action.Citation Format:Shigehiro Yagishita, Sho Sato, Daisuke Shintani, Tadaaki Nishikawa, Aiko Ogasawara, Masanori Yasuda, Hironori Ishii, Keiji Furuuchi, Toshimitsu Uenaka, Hiroshi Yoshida, Kosei Hasegawa, Akinobu Hamada.

    "abstract": "Claudin18.2 is a highly specific tight junction protein that is minimally expressed in normal tissues but aberrantly activated and overexpressed in various malignancies, particularly digestive system tumors such as gastric cancer (approximately 70%) and pancreatic cancer (around 50%). In these tumors, the loss of cell polarity exposes Claudin18.2 on the cell surface, making it accessible to biologics and effector cells. Innovative therapeutic strategies, including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, ADCs, and CAR-T cells, leverage this accessibility to enhance tumor-targeting precision and immune activation. Combining Claudin18.2-targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 blockade, holds promising therapeutic potential.To evaluate the efficacy of antibody drugs and ADCs, tumor cell lines overexpressing tumor-associated antigens are critical. We generated MC38-CLDN18.2 murine colon cancer cell lines by overexpressing human CLDN18.2 in MC38 cells. Human CLDN18.2 protein expression was confirmed by flow cytometry. The tumorigenic potential of MC38-CLDN18.2 cells was further validated in vivo.To investigate novel combination therapies or bispecific antibodies targeting CLDN18.2 and PD-1 in an immunocompetent model, we developed a humanized PD-1 (hPD1) mouse model on a C57BL/6 (C57) background. Using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene engineering, the murine Pdcd1 gene was replaced with the human PDCD1 gene, ensuring full-length human PD-1 protein expression in the knock-in model. Human PD-1 protein expression was validated by FACS analysis after in vivo anti-CD3 stimulation.The tumor growth inhibition of two CLDN18.2 monoclonal antibodies (IMAB362 and ASKB589) was evaluated in hPD1 mice engrafted with MC38-CLDN18.2 syngeneic tumors. The therapeutic effects of these antibodies were also investigated in combination with anti-PD-1 treatment. Both anti-CLDN18.2 monotherapies demonstrated moderate antitumor efficacy, while their combination with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade produced significant synergistic effects, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression and increased antitumor immunity with robust T-cell infiltration.In summary, the humanized PD-1 mouse model and MC38-CLDN18.2 cell line provide robust in vivo platforms to evaluate novel therapeutic candidates targeting CLDN18.2.Citation Format:Jane Hong, Shuang Li, Xiaolei Qiu, Hechun Ma, Yi Li, Ruilin Sun.

    "abstract": "Peptide-drug-conjugates (PDCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) in oncology. PDCs, with their smaller size (<10 kDa), can offer improved tumor penetration. Additionally, PDCs can potentially exhibit a better safety profile due to their shorter blood PK, absence of an Fc domain, and reduced immunogenicity. Furthermore, PDCs can be entirely chemically synthesized, providing a homogeneous chemical entity. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a key target that is overexpressed in many tumor types. Current EGFR inhibitors primarily focus on mutant forms, creating a treatment gap for tumors with only wild-type overexpression. Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX) represents another cancer-specific marker that supports tumor survival in hypoxic or acidic conditions and is frequently co-overexpressed with EGFR in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck cancers, and pancreatic cancers. SYNB011128, a bispecific PDC, exhibits high affinity and specificity for binding both EGFR and CAIX. Upon internalization, SYNB011128 releases MMAE, a potent tubulin inhibitor, through linker cleavage by tumor-specific proteases. In total, SYNB011128 employs three primary anti-cancer mechanisms: 1) Competing with EGF to inhibit the EGFR pathway. 2) Inhibiting CAIX enzyme function, crucial for cancer cell survival in hypoxic environments and resistance clone development. 3) Delivering the cytotoxic MMAE payload. Preclinical studies showed that SYNB011128 achieved complete tumor regression in multiple pancreatic and colon cancer models, outperforming EGFR-antibody-drug conjugates (EGFR-ADCs). Additionally, SYNB011128 showed efficacy in models of Osimertinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With a molecular weight of 4 kDa, SYNB011128 exhibited rapid and deep tumor penetration. PDC induced biomarker was detected in both the periphery and core of the tumor within 6 hours post-dosing. Despite its relatively short blood half-life, SYNB011128 ensured sustained accumulation of the payload within tumors. This pharmacokinetic profile may reduce on-target toxicity and enhance safety. In mouse studies, SYNB011128 demonstrated no adverse effects, such as weight loss or liver/kidney damage, after 28 days of treatment at doses that induced tumor regression. Chemically, SYNB011128 is synthesized as a single enantiomer, without diastereomeric isomers. In summary, PDC SYNB011128 effectively targets both EGFR and CAIX, utilizing multiple anti-cancer mechanisms and achieving deep tumor penetration, which may lead to robust clinical efficacy. By binding to two cancer antigens to enhance tumor selectivity over normal tissues, and a pharmacokinetic profile of sustained tumor accumulation vs a short blood half-life, SYNB011128 may also have an improved safety margin.Citation Format:Caihong Zhou, Michael Poss, Cheng Lu, Ruochi Zhang, Yu Wang, Yuanpeng Xiong, Xin Gao, Xiao Zhang, Yan Degenhardt.

    "abstract": "The EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway is frequently activated in cancers, particularly due to KRAS gain-of-function mutations. Certain types, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with KRAS mutations and cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 fusions, show dependency on EGFR. Recent studies demonstrate promising outcomes in metastatic colorectal cancer by combining an irreversible KRASG12C inhibitor with an EGFR inhibitor. To explore therapeutic benefits across tumor types, we analyzed the expression of EGFR and co-receptors (ERBB) in TCGA samples and CCLE models with different KRAS mutations. We also verified the reliance on ERBB receptors using DepMap data.Patient-derived organoid (PDO) models from PDAC, colorectal cancer (CRC), and CRC liver metastases were utilized to develop orthotopic tumor models. These PDO lines were characterized through mutational profiling, cell signaling analysis, RNA-sequencing, and whole exome sequencing, providing insights into their molecular features. Higher EGFR expression levels at both protein and RNA levels were observed in specific CRC PDO models, consistent in in-vitro PDO models and in-vivo PDO-derived Xenograft (PDOX) tissues from subcutaneous implantation in immunocompromised mice.Additionally, the PDO models were evaluated for sensitivity to standard of care (SOC) drugs and EGFR inhibitors, revealing EGFR expression-independent and tumor type-dependent sensitivities (e.g., Afatinib IC50: PDAC (128nM+/-123) vs CRC (2776nM+/-3099)). Surface expression levels of ERBBs were measured in in-vivo PDOX tissues to assess the comparative use case for targeting the EGFR pathway via inhibition or antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) molecules.Furthermore, we generated and validated stable tumoroid models expressing firefly luciferase in PDOs derived from primary CRC, CRC metastasis to the liver, and primary PDAC. To further validate the potential for in-vivo models, orthotopic tumor models were established in immunocompromised mice for each PDO line, monitoring tumor burden using bioluminescence imaging. Correlation with MRI and ultrasound imaging was conducted for PDAC and liver tumor burden, respectively, with significant correlation observed.Overall, this study aims to enhance understanding of tumor biology and response to treatment through the development and validation of PDO-based orthotopic models, with future work involving validation of EGFR inhibitors targeting the pathway and ADCs based on ERBBs targeting tumor cells expressing these proteins. In vivo luciferase reactivation in our models will allow us to dissect the mechanisms of resistance to these agents using physiologically relevant tumor models and single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis.Citation Format:Krishna S.

    "abstract": "Nectin-4 has emerged as a promising target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) due to its high expression in bladder cancer (BC) cells. Enfortumab vedotin (EV), an anti-Nectin-4 ADC conjugated with MMAE toxin, has demonstrated potent therapeutic activity, particularly in combination with pembrolizumab. However, resistance to EV presents a significant clinical challenge. This study aims to develop EV resistant models among Urosphere's biobank of BC patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and organoids for screening anti-Nectin-4 compounds and investigating mechanisms of resistance to EV. RNA sequencing/Affymetrix and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to quantify Nectin-4 expression. Sixteen PDX models were treated with EV (4 mg/kg, twice) to evaluate antitumor activity. Two PDX models (coded as B521 and F659) highly responsive to EV were selected to generate acquired-resistant models. They were treated with repeated EV treatments until tumors no longer regressed. Subsequently, tumor fragments from both PDX models were implanted into new NMRI mice and treated with EV to validate the resistance acquisition. Starting from PDX tumors no longer responding to EV, organoid model was established and treated to EV from 0.003 up to 10 \u00b5g/mL for five days, followed by cell viability assessment using the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae 3D assay to confirm their resistance. Urosphere\u2019s PDX biobank encompasses diverse Nectin-4 expression profiles. EV efficacy in vivo was not strictly correlated with Nectin-4 expression. B521 did not acquire any resistance whereas F659 PDX model developed resistance after \u223c200 days of repeated administration. We established the corresponding organoids and we showed that IC50 and Emax were significantly different between sensitive and resistant models. Nectin-4 expression remained stable in resistant models (mRNA and protein levels), indicating that resistance was unrelated to target loss. Transcriptomic analyses highlighted several potential mechanisms, including the upregulation of efflux transporters such as MDR1 and MRP3, which may contribute to resistance. Urosphere\u2019s PDX and organoid biobank serves as a powerful platform for advancing research on Nectin-4-targeted therapies. From the F659 PDX model, we successfully developed paired in vitro and in vivo models resistant to EV. These novel models provide valuable tools for assessing innovative therapeutic approaches for resistant tumors. Additionally, the EV-resistant models underscore the potential role of ABC transporter upregulation in resistance mechanisms, offering critical insights for the development of alternative treatment strategies.Citation Format:Claire B\u00e9raud, Emilie Decaup, Anne-Sophie Bajeot, C\u00e9line Rouget, Karine Rollet, Mathieu Roumigui\u00e9, Xavier Gam\u00e9, Philippe Lluel, Nad\u00e8ge Bidan.

    "abstract": "The leucine-rich repeat containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is crucial for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Normal tissue expression is minimal and primarily restricted to the placenta, hair follicles in the skin, and is also increased in activated fibroblasts during wound healing. In cancer, LRRC15 is overexpressed in mesenchymal malignancies including sarcomas and glioblastoma, and in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of various epithelial tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Thus, LRRC15 is a promising therapeutic target, particularly for disrupting tumor-stroma interactions that support tumor growth and hinder chemotherapy effectiveness.SOT106 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting LRRC15, comprised of a proprietary humanized monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a beta-glucuronidase (GUSB) cleavable linker for tumor specific payload release. In in vitro studies, SOT106 showed strong antigen-specific binding, efficient internalization, and cytotoxicity in the low nanomolar range. Strong and durable dose-dependent tumor growth reduction was observed in several disease-relevant mouse models, with complete responses achieved following administration of a well-tolerated and clinically relevant dose of 1 mg/kg. Importantly, SOT106 achieved efficacy at a lower dose and with less frequent administration compared to the clinical benchmark. In an exploratory study in cynomolgus monkeys, SOT106 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties with a half-life of 4.5 to 6 days without premature payload release, a preliminary non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) of approx. 10 mg/kg, and a broad therapeutic index of 40 based on allometric scaling. Further, significantly increased plasma stability was observed over the course of 14 days. Dose-limiting toxicities were consistent with the known MMAE-mediated effects. In parallel, we have also developed a highly specific proprietary diagnostic antibody to be used for prospective patient selection in Phase I/Phase II clinical trial.In summary, SOT106 is a highly effective and well-tolerated LRRC15 targeted ADC that holds promise for the clinical treatment of patients with sarcomas and other LRRC15-positive tumors.Citation Format:Michaela Fojtu, Iva Valentov\u00e1, Eli\u0161ka Kohelov\u00e1, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Zimmermann, \u0160\u00e1rka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1, Irena Adkins, Nataliia Kalynovska, Lenka Palov\u00e1 Jel\u00ednkov\u00e1, Filip Jab\u016frek, Ann Ranger, Ulrich Moebius, Martin Steegmaier, Amy Jensen-Smith, Radek \u0160p\u00ed\u0161ek.

    "abstract": "B7-H3, also known as CD276, is a type I transmembrane protein and a member of the B7 family, which includes immune checkpoints such as PD-L1. B7-H3 is over-expressed in multiple solid tumors including lung, esophageal, prostate and breast cancers. B7-H3 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have demonstrated promising early clinical antitumor activity. In contrast to ADCs, radionuclide drug conjugates (RDCs) offer not only a different therapeutic approach but also allow tumor imaging. VHH (variable heavy domain of heavy chain) is a highly attractive binder modality, however, one persistent challenge of VHH-based RDCs is the low tumor uptake together with a high kidney uptake prohibiting its application in RDC therapy. Our Clear-X\u2122 linker technology was developed to specifically address such therapeutically sub-optional biodistribution profiles that are nearly without exception shared by all VHHs and other similar-sized protein-based vectors such as affibodies and DARPins. Using Clear-X\u2122, we developed our lead B7-H3 radioligand vector FL801. The binding affinity of FL801 was assessed in vitro. In the cell-based binding assays, FL801 exhibited specific B7-H3 binding with sub-nanomolar affinity. The radiolabeling of FL801 with 177Lu resulted in radiochemical purities (RCP) of >98% and molar activities of 18.5 MBq/nmol. [177Lu]Lu-FL801 was found to be stable in the formulation buffers at 4\u00b0C for 5 days. The in vivo biodistribution profile of [177Lu]Lu-FL801 was characterized by SPECT/CT imaging and cut-and-count biodistribution studies in B7-H3-positive tumor-bearing mice. The SPECT/CT imaging of 11.1 MBq [177Lu]Lu-FL801 revealed an intense tumor uptake that was significantly higher than in all normal organs at 24 and 72 hour. In the cut-and-count biodistribution studies, [177Lu]Lu-FL801 demonstrated a therapeutically favorable profile including a tumor uptake of >30% ID/g and a tumor-to-kidney (T/K) ratio of >2.0 at 24 hour. This was a significant improvement over our starting-point VHH lead without Clear-X\u2122 modification which exhibited a tumor uptake of 2.3% ID/g and a T/K ratio of <0.01 at 24 hour. In addition, the anti-tumor activity of [177Lu]Lu-FL801was evaluated in the same model using a single dose of 11.1 MBq [177Lu]Lu-FL801 per mice. It was found that the treatment was well tolerated, and all treated animals achieved a complete remission of the tumor. In summary, the preclinical data package collectively supports to proceed towards clinical studies of [177Lu]Lu-FL801 as a potential therapeutic option for B7-H3 positive tumors. In addition, this work validated the effectiveness of Clear-X\u2122 linker technology in optimizing VHH-RDCs, and we expect Clear-X\u2122 is also applicable to other protein-based RDCs with similar molecular sizes.Citation Format:Xiaozhu Wang, Ming-Jin Jheng, Pengyun Li, Dian Li, Yihu Xie, Biao Guo, Ruyi Hu, Fa Liu.

    "abstract": "Background:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) combine a cytotoxic agent with a monoclonal antibody for targeted delivery. Enfortumab-vedotin (EV) links a monoclonal antibody targeting NECTIN-4 with the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). Given the near-ubiquitous expression of NECTIN-4 in urothelial cancer (UC) tissues, EV has shown efficacy in UC and is approved for metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). However, significant heterogeneity in NECTIN-4 expression within UC limits therapeutic efficacy in cases with low NECTIN-4 expression. This study evaluated cell cycle inhibitors' efficacy in UC cells with low NECTIN-4 expression.Methods:We measured NECTIN-4 and cell cycle-related molecules (Cyclin D1 and PLK1) in bladder cancer cell lines (253J, 253J-BV, 5637, RT4, T24, J82, HT1197, HT1376) and correlated these levels with sensitivity to the PLK1 inhibitor. Drug sensitivity was assessed by a CCK-8 assay over 72 hours following treatment with the PLK1 inhibitor (onvansertib). An ex vivo model using bladder tumor samples from patients validated the in vitro findings. NECTIN-4 levels in bladder cancer cell lines (HT1376 and RT4) were modulated by siNECTIN-4 transfection for 48 hours. Cell cycle analysis and the expression levels of cyclin D1 and PLK1 were examined in NECTIN-4 knockdown cell lines.Results:The therapeutic efficacy of the PLK1 inhibitor was significantly enhanced in bladder cancer cell lines with reduced NECTIN-4 expression (253J, 253J-BV, 5637, T24, and J82), as indicated by an IC50 <0.1 \u03bcM. In contrast, cell lines with high NECTIN-4 expression (RT4, HT1197, and HT1376) were resistant to onvansertib (IC50 >1 \u03bcM). NECTIN-4 expression correlated with cell cycle-related molecule levels. Consistently, bladder tumor samples showed a negative correlation between NECTIN-4 expression and PLK1 inhibitor sensitivity. PLK1 inhibitor-resistant tumors (IC50 >40 \u03bcM) had lower NECTIN-4 levels than sensitive samples (20 \u03bcM < IC50 < 40 \u03bcM). NECTIN-4 knockdown via siRNA increased G0/G1 phase cells and reduced cyclin D1 and PLK1 levels. Furthermore, siNECTIN-4-transfected cells were more sensitive to the PLK1 inhibitor than control siRNA-transfected cells.Conclusion:This study underscores the therapeutic potential of cell cycle inhibitors, notably PLK1 inhibitors, in bladder cancer cells with low NECTIN-4 expression, showing an inverse relationship between NECTIN-4 expression and sensitivity to PLK1 inhibitors. NECTIN-4 levels could predict PLK1 inhibitor treatment response. NECTIN-4 knockdown experiments confirmed that reduced NECTIN-4 expression disrupted cell cycle regulation and increased PLK1 inhibition efficacy. These findings advocate for further investigation of combination therapies involving ADCs and cell cycle inhibitors to counter resistance and improve outcomes in bladder cancer patients.Citation Format:Jee Soo Park, Ji Eun Lee, Myung Eun Lee, Jongchan Kim, Won Sik Ham.

    "abstract": "Background:Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a rare subtype of ovarian cancer, with a higher incidence in East Asia compared to Western countries and a tendency to affect younger individuals. OCCC has poor prognosis due to its low sensitivity to chemotherapy, presenting a significant unmet medical need. However, therapeutic development has been limited due to its rarity. Recently, advancements in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting Trophoblastic cell-surface marker (TROP2) have shown promise, but the expression of these therapeutic targets in OCCC remains unclear. This study aimed to explore new therapeutic targets for OCCC by analyzing TROP2 expression and the immune microenvironment.Methods:Clinical data were collected from OCCC patients who underwent surgery at the National Cancer Center Hospital between 2007 and 2024. TROP2 (MAB650), ARID1A (polyclonal), and PD-L1(E1L3N) were evaluated. PD-L1 expression was evaluated using both Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) and Combined Positive Score (CPS). TROP2 expression was assessed using the H-score, with a score of \u226510 defined as positive. Pathological features, including stromal characteristics, cytoplasmic features, and tissue architecture, were also analyzed.Results:A total of 125 OCCC patients were included. TROP2 expression was positive in 90 patients (72.0%) and negative in 35 patients (28.0%). ARID1A was retained in 52 patients (41.6%) and lost in 73 patients (58.4%). TPS values were <1 in 44 patients (35.2%), 1-49 in 73 patients (58.4%), and \u226550 in 8 patients (6.4%). CPS values were <1 in 33 patients (26.4%), 1-9 in 30 patients (24.0%), and \u226510 in 62 patients (49.6%). No significant differences were observed in TROP2 expression across these variables. Overall survival did not significantly differ between TROP2-positive and TROP2-negative patients (HR=1.22, 95%CI: 0.48-3.09, p=0.67). ARID1A status was also not associated with survival (HR=1.48, 95%CI: 0.62-3.49, p=0.37). However, CPS \u226510 was associated with a trend toward worse prognosis (HR=2.92, 95%CI: 0.95-8.41, p=0.06). Poor prognosis was also observed in cases with high stromal inflammation (HR=2.47, 95%CI: 1.09-5.60, p=0.03) and solid tissue architecture (HR=2.89, 95%CI: 0.99-8.46, p=0.05). Patients with both CPS \u226510 and TROP2 positivity accounted for 47 individuals (37.6%) and showed a trend toward worse prognosis compared to CPS-negative and TROP2-negative patients (HR=3.17, 95%CI: 0.71-14.06, p=0.13).Conclusions:In OCCC, 72% of patients exhibited TROP2 positivity, and 49.6% had CPS \u226510. Patients with CPS positivity tended to have worse prognosis, and those with both TROP2 and CPS positivity represented 37.6% of the cohort. These findings suggest that TROP2-ADC and combination immunotherapy may represent promising therapeutic strategies for this patient subgroup.Citation Format:Toru Imai, Yuki Kojima, Hiroshi Yoshida, Rui Kitadai, Mai Hoshino, Ayumi Saito, Munehiro Ito, Shosuke Kita, Aiko Maejima, Kazuki Sudo, Masaya Uno, Tatsunori Shimoi, Mitsuya Ishikawa, Kan Yonemori.

    "abstract": "Purpose:Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a key therapy for HER2+/HER2-low metastatic breast cancer (mBC), but up to 50% of patients develop resistance. Resistance mechanisms have implicated dysfunctions in DNA repair, lysosomal activity, and immune responses. This study combines spatial omics and quantum-inspired regulatory network analysis to investigate tumor-immune-extracellular matrix interactions contributing to T-DXd resistance.Methods:Using NanoString GeoMX, spatial proteomics were analyzed in 29 metastatic tissue sections from 15 responsive (R) and 14 non-responsive (NR) patients. Across 6-8 regions of interest per section, immune and stromal components were quantified. Additionally, a subset of samples (n = 2R, 2NR) underwent GeoMX whole transcriptomics profiling and analysis using both classical and quantum-inspired algorithms.Results:NR tumors consistently exhibited immunosuppression, disorganized immune responses, upregulated fibronectin, and poor infiltration of granzyme B-producing cells. Organ-specific findings included:\u2022NR bone and brain mets showed increased spatial correlations between dendritic cells and T-cell exhaustion markers (PD-L1, CTLA4), suggesting niches of immune suppression.\u2022NR bone mets showed increased spatial correlation of fibronectin correlated with immune markers, indicating that stiffer ECM physically blocks immune infiltration. \u2022R chest wall mets showed upregulated smooth muscle actin (SMA), possibly reflecting vascular remodeling and enhanced immune infiltration.Additionally, spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed the following::\u2022Tumor-associated B cells were identified in NR samples, interacting with exhausted T cells and the Wnt-catenin pathway. \u2022QuantumGRN revealed interactions in immune cells involving RBPP4 with DNMT3A and TAF4, linked to altered chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, respectively.Conclusions:This work shows that T-DXd response is heavily influenced by microenvironment remodeling and immune infiltration. This work highlights the value of spatial omics for uncovering ADC-resistance mechanisms, as well as the value of quantum-inspired computing for identifying novel therapeutic targets. In addition to collecting more spatial and single-cell omics data, future directionsinclude pathway validation in animal models and computationally simulating quantum and molecular dynamics of ADC resistance.Citation Format:Glori Das, Wenjuan Dong, Matthew Vasquez, Ji-hoon Lee, Yuan Gao, Jenny Chang, Xiaoxian Li, Hong Zhao, Stephen T.

    "abstract": "Background:Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a very aggressive subtype of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), for which therapeutic strategies are currently lacking. NEPC is rare de-novo (<1% of the cases) but can represent 15 to 20% of cases after failure of the treatment targeting the androgen receptor (AR) axis (such as enzalutamide, abiraterone) in. Carcinoembryogenic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) has been previously identified as an attractive NEPC cell surface antigen. Here, we investigate its expression in NEPC patient specimens and its therapeutic potential as a target for Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) therapy.Methods:Tumor biopsy specimens were obtained from the prospective trial MATCH-R (NCT02517892). Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were established and both patient biopsies (n=59) and PDX (n=16) were characterized by RNAseq and immunohistochemistry (IHC). 5 PDX from our 16 models were selected based on their CEACAM5 expression for our pharmacological assay: 2 NEPC models with a high expression of CEACAM5, 1 NEPC model with a mild (weak) expression of CEACAM5, 1 NEPC model with no expression of CEACAM5 and 1 mCRPC with a luminal phenotype and no expression of CEACAM5. SAR408701, an anti-CEACAM5 ADC or an irrelevant ADC with no specific target was administrated to immunodeficient mice. Tumor growth and body weight were monitored twice a week for 21 days post-injection.Results:54 patient biopsies were collected for IHC and 59 for RNAseq analysis. 33 cases out of the 54 presented evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation (in IHC analysis)tusamitamab and 21 expressed synaptophysin in more than 50% of the tumor cells. CEACAM5 expression in tumor cells was detected in 12 cases which all expressed synaptophysin (>50%), suggesting a strong correlation between CEACAM5 expression and neuroendocrine differentiation. An unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on RNAseq analysis of patient samples showed an enriched neuroendocrine cluster, in which CEACAM5 was significantly overexpressed. In the 5 PDX models selected to test the activity of Tusamitamab Ravtansine based on CEACAM5 expression, a strong correlation between CEACAM5 expression in the PDX models and response to Tusamitamab Ravtansine was observed, with Tusamitamab Ravtansine showing a strong antitumoral activity on CEACAM5 expressing PDX models and no efficacy in models lacking CEACAM5 expression.Conclusion:Overall, these results demonstrate the efficacy and specificity of SAR408701 against NEPC tumors harboring CEACAM5.This study provides preclinical evidence of the antitumor activity of SAR408701 in CEACAM5-positive NEPC.Funding:Gustave Roussy, Cancer Campus, Grand ParisCitation Format:Loic Poiraudeau, Bigot Ludovic, Cedric Pobel, Naoual Menssouri, Marine Aglave, Catline Nobre, Alice Bernard-Tessier, Natacha Naoun, Anna Patrikidou, Claudio Nicotra, Maud Ngocamus, Benjamin Besse, Karim Fizazi, Jean-Yves Scoazec, Anne-Marie Lefebvre, Celine Nicolazzi, Nathalie Mace, Anne-Laure Bauchet, Yohann Loriot.

    "abstract": "Background:Epidemiologic studies commonly obtain important exposure and outcome information from patient self-report although these may be influenced by imperfect understanding and/or faulty recall. The Voyage Study is a large-scale, prospective cohort study of long-term health outcomes among participants with a valid multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test order (N=150, 047). The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the validity of participant reported mt-sDNA tests, colorectal cancer (CRC), and/or aerodigestive cancers (ADC, including cancers of the head, neck, oral, esophageal, lung, liver, stomach, pancreas, anus) among respondents.Methods:Participants from across the Unites States enrolled in the study completing questionnaires at enrollment and 1 year. The year 1 questionnaire collected data on completion and outcome of their mt-sDNA test, follow up colonoscopies and other procedures as well as a diagnosis of CRC or ADC. The study team contacts those who reported either CRC or ADC for permission to obtain copies of medical records. Records are then reviewed by a trained nurse abstractor and evaluated for validity. Mt-sDNA test results were available from Exact Sciences.Results:At the time of this analysis, year 1 questionnaire data were available on 135, 035 participants. Abnormal mt-sDNA results (n=12, 928) were self-reported by 13, 420 participants with 96.3% accuracy. Of the 111, 556 self-reported normal results, 93.4% (n=104, 150) were reported correctly. The validation process for the Voyage Study is ongoing with 860 self-reported CRC and 318 self-reported aerodigestive cancer diagnoses to date. Complete data are available on 155 individuals with a self-report of a new CRC diagnosis and 63 individuals with a self-report of aerodigestive cancer. Abstraction confirmed 47% (n=73) of those reported as true CRC diagnoses. Participants were better at correctly reporting at least one aerodigestive cancer (73%, n=46).Discussion and Conclusions:Patient reported medical record validation poses a unique challenge in today\u2019s world. The process of requesting participant authorization followed by institutional requests to release the medical records to the research team is slow and painstaking. We found that patients are able to correctly report their mt-sDNA tests but found a relatively low proportion of reported cancer diagnoses reported correctly. This underscores the need to continue to validate key outcomes rather than relying solely on participant responses. As the number of outcomes validated increases, the study team will look at a variety of social and economic factors to better understand what contributes to or hinders an accurate self-report.Citation Format:Emily J.

    "abstract": "Using advanced O-glycoproteomics we pinpointed relevant glycopeptide epitopes and developed a highly cancer-specific, humanized monoclonal antibody (R800). This antibody binds to truncated O-glycans in the context of a peptide backbone with low nanomolar affinity. The crystal structure of R800 provides insights into its binding specificity showing direct interaction with both peptide and the truncated glycan. Development of a companion diagnostic assay based on immunohistochemistry with the humanized therapeutic antibody confirmed the specificity of R800 across multiple epithelial cancers. This included selective binding to 20-30% of both primary and metastatic triple negative breast, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. There was no binding to healthy tissues. The versatility of R800 allows the application of the mAb in multiple therapeutic modalities, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies (CAR-T cells) and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). In CAR-T cell applications using R800's antigen-binding domain demonstrated potent, selective cytotoxicity against R800-target expressing cancer cells in vitro in vivo in CDX models. In ADC applications, R800 formulated with either the anti-mitotic agent, monomethyl auristatin E payload (R800-MMAE) or with the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload, exatecan (R800- exatecan) show potent activity in vitro (EC50 \u223c1nM) across multiple cell lines. Both R800 ADCs effectively eliminated tumors in preclinical PDX models, including lung, ovarian, and TN breast PDx models with a MED of 2mg/kg. By targeting the cancer-specific truncated O-glycans recognised by R800, we exploit a novel target space offering unparalleled cancer selectivity. This strategy holds significant potential for enhancing the efficacy and safety of treatments for solid tumors.Citation Format:Aaron C.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting Trop-2 (human trophoblast cell surface antigen 2) are a promising class of therapeutics with potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer. Dato-DXd, a Trop-2 targeted ADC, has demonstrated encouraging activity, leading to further interest in testing combinatorial approaches. However, a greater understanding of its effects on the tumor microenvironment (TME) are needed to identify optimal combinations. Herein we examine tumor-stromal interactions in response to Dato-DXd in ex vivo three dimensional-lung tumor models (3D-LTMs).Methods:3D-LTMs were generated utilizing freshly isolated, remnant human lung tumor specimen from patients undergoing tumor resection (Institutional Review Board approved protocol) and continuously perfused with culture media to provide nutrient circulation. Starting on day 3 of culture, 4, 6, or 8 mg/kg Dato-DXd or vehicle control was added to circulating media. Dato-DXd used in this study was purchased from a 3rd party commercial vendor (MedChemExpress). On day 14 of culture (day 11 of ADC treatment) histologic and flow cytometry analyses were performed.Results:An increased trend in the percentage of apoptotic cells (18.5\u00b11.5 vs. 13\u00b11.5; p=0.13) was noted with 6 mg/kg Dato-DXd when compared to vehicle control. Additionally, a significant reduction in the percentage of tumor cells (p=0.025) and a significant increase in non-viable tumor cells (p=0.047) was observed with this dose when compared to vehicle treated tissues. No differences in fibroblasts, CD45+ immune cells, CD8+ T cells, endothelial cells, or non-viable fibroblasts was observed between 6 mg/kg Dato-DXd and control. When an 8 mg/kg dose was utilized a significant increase in total CD45+ immune cells (p=0.0007) and CD8+ T cells (p=0.012) and an increasing trend in endothelial cells (p=0.099) was observed when compared to vehicle control. No significant changes in apoptosis, tumor cells, fibroblasts, or non-viable tumor cells or fibroblasts were observed when comparing this dose to control. When proportions were normalized to reduce variability across tissues, an increase in apoptotic cells was observed in 3 of 5 samples assessed at 4 mg/kg, and 4 of 5 samples at 6 and 8 mg/kg. An increase in immune cells (CD45+) was observed in 3 of 5 samples at 6 and 8 mg/kg. An increase in CD8+ T cells was observed in 3 of 5 samples at 8 mg/kg.Conclusion:We observed a notable trend towards an increase in immune cell populations (e.g. CD8+ T cells) following Dato-DXd treatment in 3D-LTMs. These preliminary findings indicate an enhanced anti-tumor immune response following treatment with Dato-DXd. Collectively, data suggest that Dato-DXd induces significant alterations in the TME which may facilitate the evaluation of rational drug combinations to amplify the anti-tumor response.Citation Format:Kayla F.

    "abstract": "The growing multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) patient population which becomes refractory to available treatments requires new, effective and convenient therapies with novel mechanisms of action. SKY-1214 is a small molecule that modulates splicing of FANCL and FANCI pre-mRNA, causing exon skipping and introduction of premature termination codons leading to the downregulation of FANCL and FANCI mRNAs and proteins. FANCL and FANCI are critical components of the Fanconi anemia DNA damage repair pathway, which contributes to maintenance of genomic integrity. SKY-1214 shows anti-cancer activity as single agent in multiple MM and NHL cell lines, including models of high-risk MM and NHL. In vivo, SKY-1214 treatment results in tumor growth inhibition and regression in MM and NHL cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models. The combination of SKY-1214 with small molecule agents used for the treatment of MM and NHL, including vincristine, dexamethasone and selinexor, results in improved inhibition of cell growth and viability in multiple cell lines. In vivo, the combinations result in improved tumor growth inhibition and regression and increased durability of effect upon treatment cessation in CDX models. Here, we describe the results of in vitro combination studies of SKY-1214 with antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and monoclonal antibodies. Cell growth and viability were assessed using cell viability assays (CellTiter-Glo2.0 or FACS-based assays) in tumor cells monoculture or in co-culture with T cells or NK cells to evaluate the combination with monoclonal antibodies. Combination of SKY-1214 with the BCMA-targeting ADC belantamab mafodotin shows additive and synergistic effect in specific concentration ranges resulting in enhanced cell killing in a panel of MM cell lines. Combination of SKY-1214 with bispecific antibodies, including \u03b1CD3-\u03b1BCMA, in co-culture with T cells shows additive effect. Additive effect is observed also for the combination of SKY-1214 with monoclonal antibodies in co-culture with NK cells. SKY-1214 treatment shows single agent anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo in MM and NHL models and combines well with small molecule agents, ADCs and monoclonal antibodies used for the treatment of these disorders. These data, together with the favorable oral bioavailability and pharmacologic characteristics of SKY-1214 with a distinctive mechanism of action, warrants future development in the clinic.Citation Format:Simone Rauch, Stefan Reber, Montserrat Perez-Salvia, Marco Pregnolato, Botao Liu, Loren Berry, Olesia Buiakova, Hasane Ratni, Brian Gudenas, Carlo Cusulin, Lauren Shanahan, Davide Isaia, Corinna Spohr, Anna Groener, Joseph Duffy, Steven Taylor, Veronica Costa, Sergey Paushkin.

    "abstract": "The ovarian cancer treatment landscape has seen an emergence of biomarker-targeted therapies following accelerated approval of the folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (MIRV, Elahere) in November 2022 (with full US approval granted in March 2024). Many therapies in development are biomarker-directed ADCs with distinct cytotoxic payloads, which is the major effector component of the ADC. Data suggest mechanisms of resistance may be largely payload specific, meaning patients may only be able to receive a limited number of these therapies; thus making it paramount to identify the therapy from which each individual patient will derive maximal clinical benefit. Eligibility for MIRV is currently evaluated by FR\u03b1 expression as assessed by the immunohistochemical VENTANA FOLR1 (FOLR1-2.1) RxDx Assay (FOLR1 CDx). FR\u03b1 is expressed in roughly 95% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, with around 36% prevalence observed at the cutoff for MIRV eligibility (PS2 \u2265 75%, or \u226575% of viable tumor cells with \u22652+ staining). The goal of this study was to characterize the spatial overlap of FR\u03b1 expression and prevalence with biomarkers that are currently being or could be leveraged for targeted therapeutics in the ovarian space. FR\u03b1 expression was evaluated in commercially procured, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary ovarian tumor specimens using the FOLR1 CDx. HER2, Muc16, Mesothelin, TROP2, CLDN6, B7-H4, CDH6, Tissue factor and Napi2B were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry from serial sections taken from the same FFPE blocks. Intensity staining for each biomarker was correlated to FR\u03b1 intensity staining to identify overlapping eligible patient populations. In addition to intensity overlap, spatial expression patterns of each biomarker relative to FR\u03b1 were also evaluated to understand sequencing and combinability options. These data shed light on biomarker co-expression in ovarian cancer to best match patients to the ideal targeted therapy and to best tailor optimal combination therapies in ovarian cancer patients.Citation Format:Marian Themeles, Kevin Kolahi, Amita Mistry, Erik Huntzicker, Peter Ansell, Emily Deutschman.

    "abstract": "Background:Claudin 6 (CLDN6) is a clinically validated target for many solid tumors notably ovarian, endometrial, and testicular cancer. Its expression is restricted to tumor cells and fetal tissues with little or no detectable in normal tissues. As such, CLDN6 represents an attractive therapeutic target for the development of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Here, we describe the development and preclinical characterization of a novel ADC called PLB-002, which consists of a highly selective CLDN6 targeting antibody, PLB-002-ab7, conjugated to a FDA-approved microtubule inhibitor, eribulin, via a Primelink Biotherapeutics proprietary enzyme-cleavable linker with an optimized average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4.0. PLB-002-ab7 is a novel humanized anti-CLDN6 single-domain antibody (Mw. 78.8 kDa) with highly binding affinity and selectivity to CLDN6 with barely binding to related CLDN family members (CLDN9, CLDN3, and CLDN4) in protein and cell based binding assays.Methods:The in vitro binding affinity of the PLB-002 was determined by flow cytometry on OVCAR3, PA-1, OVCA429, OV90, and NEC-8 cells. Cell internalization effect was evaluated by an in-direct flow cytometry assay on OVCAR3, PA-1, and OV90 cells. In vitro cytotoxicity was measured using Cell-Titer Glo assay on OVCAR3, OV90, and NEC-8 cells. In vivo anti-tumor efficacy was investigated using several cancer cell derived xenograft (CDX) models of OVCAR3, OV90, and NEC-8 cells, as well as patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of ovarian cancer with CLDN6 high, moderate, low and negative expression. A dose-range finding (DRF) safety study of PLB-002 was performed in cynomolgus monkeys. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) data of PLB-002 in CDX mice were determined by LC-MS/MS method.Results:PLB-002 exhibited strong binding, rapid internalization effect, and potent antitumor activity in vitro on OV90 (CLDN6 low expression) and OVCAR3 (CLDN6 high expression) cells with nano-molar range of IC50. When evaluated in OVCAR3 and OV90 CDXs of ovarian cancer, NEC-8 CDX of testicular germ cell tumor, and OV PDXs, PLB-002 showed strong tumor regression in a dose-dependent manner, which is consistent with the PK analyses showing high exposure, slow clearance and long half-life for both total antibody and conjugated drug. In a non-human primate study using cynomolgus monkey, PLB-002 showed favorable safety profile with no clinical symptoms of toxicities up to the highest tested dose.Conclusions:These results show that PLB-002 has remarkable antitumor activity and support the clinical development as a therapeutic ADC for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other CLDN6 expressing solid cancer.Citation Format:Haitao Pan, Qing Zhang, Ganyuan Xiao, Guangchao Zhang, Jiaxin Li, Ling Xin, Kia J.

    "abstract": "The combination of anti-TROP2 ADCs with PD-(L)1 inhibitors represents a promising therapeutic strategy, merging targeted therapy with immunotherapy to improve treatment outcomes. Clinical trials are underway to explore its safety and efficacy in various cancer types. However, challenges remain, including accumulative toxicity, dosing difficulties, and tumor resistance. Bispecific ADCs (BiADCs), which target two antigens simultaneously, offer a promising advancement by enhancing tumor specificity, improving therapeutic efficacy, and reducing damage to healthy tissues. BiADCs are emerging as a pivotal innovation in oncology, particularly for difficult-to-treat cancers.Here, we present preclinical findings for ALG01, a novel anti-PD-L1\u00d7TROP2 BiADC with STAR (Smart TME (Tumor Microenvironment) Activated Release) technology and incorporated with targeted therapy and immunotherapy in one molecule, has shown remarkable anti-tumor activity and a favorable safety profile. ALG01 comprises a humanized PD-L1-targeting IgG1 fused with TROP2-targeting biparatopic VHHs at the C-terminal of the heavy chain, linked to exatecan via transglutaminase-mediated site-specific conjugation. In vitro studies demonstrated that ALG01 exhibits potent cytotoxicity against various TROP2 and/or PD-L1-positive cancer cell lines. Ex vivo, ALG01 was selectively and efficiently cleaved by proteases as designed within tumor tissues, compared to plasma and normal tissues (e.g., liver, spleen, lung), resulting in the release of anti-PD-L1 IgG1 and small-size anti-TROP2 VHH-drug conjugates. In vivo, ALG01 significantly regressed tumors in a TROP2-positive cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model. Furthermore, in a MC38-PDL1-TROP2 syngeneic model, ALG01 treatment led to complete tumor eradication in 7 of 8 mice, showing significantly superior efficacy compared to reference anti-TROP2 ADC and its combination with reference anti-PD-L1 antibody.A rechallenge study further supported long-lasting ALG01's anti-tumor efficacy. After complete (8 of 8 mice) tumor eradication following a single dose of ALG01, mice were re-inoculated with tumor cells without additional treatment. Remarkably, the newly implanted tumors in 7 of 8 mice were once again fully eliminated, revealing a lasting immune activated memory effect. In toxicology studies, ALG01 was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys, with the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) observed at \u226545 mg/kg for DAR6 or \u226565 mg/kg for DAR4.These preclinical findings indicate that ALG01 offers a wide therapeutic window and may benefit patients with challenging-to-treat cancers.

    "abstract": "ROR1 is a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the ROR family. It is a receptor for Wnt family signaling molecules Wnt5a, and plays a critical role in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, survival, and migration. Being an oncofetal protein, ROR1 exhibits limited expression in most normal tissues. However, it is abnormally expressed in various hematological and solid cancers, contributing to the development and progression of many types of cancer. Due to its overexpression in cancer, ROR1 presents as a highly attractive target for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy. The current clinical results of ROR1 ADCs have been promising in treating patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) hematologic malignancies.BR111 is anti-ROR1 ADC that consists of a biparatopic antibody, stably conjugated to an antimitotic agent. The biparatopic antibodies demonstrate superior binding affinity to ROR1-expressing cancer cells compared to single epitope antibodies. Notably, our unique and innovative conjugation platform CysX\u2122, not only prevents payload detachment during circulation and reducing the off-target toxicity, but also enables a uniformed drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4.Recent translational medicine studies showed that ROR1 is relatively highly expressed in the patients of many solid tumors including sarcoma, gastric cancer, TNBC, endometrial cancer, etc. And BR111 has demonstrated efficacy in in vitro and in vivo models of those indications. BR111 has also showed synergistic efficacy when combined with PD-1/L1 antibodies, SIRP\u03b1 antibody and several chemotherapeutics. Studies have also shown that ROR1 levels increase while HER2 levels decrease in cell lines treated with DS-8201, and BR111 showed improved efficacy in DS-8201 resistant cell line as well as in combination with DS-8201. The promising outcome holds great potential as a therapeutic treatment for hematological and solid cancers, offering a better safety profile. BR111 has great potential in further clinical evaluations.Citation Format:Qinqin Zhuang, Yan Sun, Lilv Fan, Qianqian Tao, Xiaobei Zhao, Jie Zhu, Zhenhua Wu, Lei Nie, Gang Chen, Haibin Wang.

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant public health challenge, with an urgent need of novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PTK7, a membrane tyrosine pseudokinase and Wnt receptor, is overexpressed in CRC and linked to poor prognosis. In CRC, PTK7 expression correlates with metastatic progression and decreased survival in non-metastatic patients, positioning PTK7 as both a potential biomarker and a promising drug target. Notably, a targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) against PTK7 has recently shown efficacy in inducing tumor regression in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of solid tumors and has progressed to a Phase I clinical trial with promising results. Other PTK7-targeting ADCs and anti-PTK7 CAR-T cells recently entered into preclinical development.At the plasma membrane, PTK7 can interact with a range of membrane receptors, including VEGFR, EGFR, ROR2, and Plexins, enhancing their signaling capabilities. Using biotin proximity labeling in HCT116 CRC cells, we identified a novel network of PTK7-associated membrane proteins. Among these, we focused on EPHA2, an active tyrosine kinase receptor also implicated in cancer. Our findings indicate that PTK7 and EPHA2 interact via their extracellular domains (ECDs), and that PTK7 depletion significantly upregulates EPHA2 expression and signaling in response to its ligand EFNA-1 in HCT116 cells. Additionally, PTK7 regulates EPHA2\u2019s endosomal sorting through a Rab11-dependent mechanism, as well as its K63-linked ubiquitination and subsequent lysosomal degradation. Mechanistically, PTK7 does not appear to participate directly in EFNA-1 binding but instead promotes multimerization of active EPHA2, a crucial step in amplifying EPHA2 signaling.This study aims to elucidate the functional role of the interaction between PTK7 and EPHA2 in colorectal cancer progression. By mapping the PTK7:EPHA2 interface using AlphaFold3 predictions and introducing targeted deletions and mutations within the ECDs of both receptors, we seek to understand how disrupting this interaction influences tumorigenic and metastatic processes. Our findings indicate that PTK7 depletion triggers cell rounding and detachment, with a marked increase in total and activated EPHA2 levels, which may drive pro-metastatic activity in vivo. Outcomes may significantly impact the use of anti-PTK7-ADCs or CAR-T cells and orient new therapeutic strategies to design agents interfering with PTK7 and EPHA2 interaction and function.Citation Format:Charlotte Dessaux, Constantin Semenchenko, Luc Camoin, St\u00e9phane Audebert, Emilie Baudelet, Avais Daulat, Flavio Maina, Jean-Paul Borg.

    "abstract": "Purpose:To develop a treatment for HER2 positive patients whose tumors have stopped responding to EnhertuMethods:HER2 positive BT474 breast cancer cells were induced to become Herceptin resistant (trastuzumab resistant) in vitro via prolonged exposure to sub-lethal levels of the drug. Analysis of the trastuzumab-resistant cells showed that they had greatly increased expression of MUC1*, known to have anti-apoptotic and pro-growth properties. Recall that MUC1* (muk 1 star) is a growth factor receptor created after cleavage and release of the N-terminal portion of MUC1. The targeting antibody, huMNC2, has already demonstrated safety and cancer selectivity in a 1st-in-human CAR-T clinical trial for treatment of metastatic breast cancers. MNC2 is an IgG1 antibody that only recognizes the conformational epitope created when MUC1 is cleaved by specific tumor-associated enzymes. Confocal microscopy and pHrodo show that MNC2 is rapidly and robustly internalized by the cancer cells. We conjugated MNC2 to deruxtecan to yield an MNC2-deruxtecan with a DAR of 7.4. Female NSG mice were xenografted with either BT474-wt cells or the trastuzumab-resistant cells, BT474-Res2. Tumors were allowed to engraft then treated with trastuzumab or MNC2-deruxtecan.Results:Herceptin had little to no effect on BT474-Res2 implanted tumors. However, MNC2-deruxtecan potently killed the trastuzumab resistant tumors in a matter of weeks. MNC2 conjugated to other linker-payloads similarly killed the trastuzumab resistant tumors. Treated animals showed no obvious signs of toxicities.Conclusions:Patients with HER2 positive breast cancers have benefitted greatly from the new ADC Enhertu (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan). However, most patients, develop resistance to HER2-directed therapies and experience progressive disease leaving them with few treatment options. Here we\u2019ve shown that HER2 positive breast cancer cells acquire resistance to trastuzumab by increasing expression of the powerful growth factor receptor MUC1*. These MUC1*-targeting ADCs offer an effective treatment for these patients. These data support a conclusion that a MUC1*-ADC is safe and could have high therapeutic value for patients who have stopped responding to Enhertu.Citation Format:Cynthia C. Bamdad, Benoit J.

    "abstract": "Background:Historically, characterization of HER2 status has focused on stratifying tumors that over express HER2, known as HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC), and those that do not, known as HER2-negative (HER2-) BC. Approximately half of all BCs, considered HER2-, express low levels of HER2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Although HER2-low BCs are resistant to traditional HER2-targeted therapies, recent trials have demonstrated they are sensitive to the antibody drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). Tumor expression of HER2 was hypothesized to be required for response to T-DXd, however studies have demonstrated its efficacy in patients with tumors that stained <1+ on IHC, considered HER2-zero (HER2-0) disease. We hypothesize that the HER2 heterogeneity in HER2-low and HER2-0 tumors makes IHC a suboptimal prediction tool. Thus, there is a clinical need for other quantification methods to determine if HER2 represents a valid biomarker to predict response to T-DXd.Methods:We measured HER2 levels by flow cytometry (FC) in IHC-determined HER2-low and HER2-0 BC cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and correlated the results to T-DXd sensitivity in vitro. To determine if HER2 is required for response to T-DXd, ERBB2 knocked down by siRNA and CRISPR-CAS9 HER2-knock out (HER2-KO) variants from the HER2-low and HER2-0 parental cell lines and PDOs were generated. To model intratumor HER2 heterogeneity, mixtures of HER2 depleted cells with control cells were made to assess T-DXd efficacy in tumors with decreasing amounts of HER2-expressing cells. To assess ADC uptake, cell lines and PDOs were treated with fluorescently tagged T-DXd and intracellular ADC levels were measured by immunofluorescence. Relative amounts of deruxtecan deposition in the TME were quantified by mass spectrometry. In vivo studies using mixtures of CAS9-control and HER2-KO HER2-low cells implanted into NSG mice are ongoing.Results:FC quantification of HER2 levels across BC cell lines and PDOs were reproducible and agreed with IHC results. Levels of HER2 expression directly correlated with sensitivity to T-DXd, and HER2 expression was required for response. Cell mixtures of HER2 knockdown + SCBi-control cells or CAS9-control and HER2-KO cells were more representative of PDO HER2 heterogeneity as quantified by FC. Growth assays of cell mixtures showed sensitivity to T-DXd was the same regardless of if there were 100%, 50% or <25% HER2-expressing cells.Conclusions:FC represents a novel method for predicting tumor cell response to T-DXd as it can reproducibly quantify HER2 heterogeneity within the TME. Our results suggest that small amounts of HER2-expressing cells are sufficient to elicit response to T-DXd, which may be missed on IHC. Thus, use of techniques like FC to quantify HER2 levels may identify T-DXd responders in the IHC-defined HER2-0 population, thus broadening the eligible patient population that benefits.Citation Format:Daniel S.

    "abstract": "Luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta; STRO-002) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) designed to target folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1)-positive cancers across a broad range of expression levels. It is composed of an anti-FR\u03b1 antibody conjugated to a tubulin-directed hemiasterlin payload via a protease-cleavable linker. The linker-payload is site-specifically conjugated via non-natural amino acids incorporated into the antibody sequence using Sutro\u2019s Xpress CF+\u00ae system, yielding a homogenous ADC with a drug-antibody ratio of four (DAR4). Preliminary results from Phase 1 and 2/3 studies in endometrial and ovarian cancer, respectively, show robust clinical activity and enhanced tolerability of luvelta as a single agent and in combination with bevacizumab. Here, we report preclinical data to support therapeutic targeting of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), for which there remains an unmet medical need, with luvelta.IHC staining of NSCLC patient tumor microarrays shows a prevalence of 48% and 14% FR\u03b1-positive tumors in non-squamous and squamous NSCLC tumors, respectively, as defined by \u22651% tumor cells with FR\u03b1 membrane staining at any intensity. In NSCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, luvelta treatment resulted in robust tumor growth inhibition, with best responses strongly correlating with FR\u03b1 levels. The majority of PDX models evaluated were EGFR wild type, but responses were also observed in some EGFR mutant models.An existing standard-of-care option for NSCLC is immunotherapy. ADCs and chemotherapeutic drugs have been shown to promote an inflamed tumor environment by triggering immunogenic cell death (ICD), which can synergize with immune checkpoint blockade. We provide evidence that luvelta is a potent inducer of ICD. In in vitro assays, luvelta induced all three hallmarks of ICD: HMGB1 release, ATP release, and surface expression of calreticulin. Furthermore, in in vivo vaccination studies, injection of luvelta-treated tumor cells established protective immunity against subsequent tumor challenge. Consistent with ICD induction, luvelta treatment in combination with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors resulted in enhanced in vivo efficacy in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Luvelta treatment in tumor-bearing mice also altered tumor immune cell infiltration and activation, demonstrating its ability to modulate the tumor immune microenvironment.In conclusion, the work presented here provides support for luvelta as a promising targeted therapy for NSCLC, either as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. Luvelta is now being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC (NCT06555263).Citation Format:Robert Yuan, Andrew McGeehan, Sihong Zhou, Mark Armanini, Jennifer Smith, Millicent Embry, Rhoneil Pena, Danielle K.

    "abstract": "Background:TRAIL death receptors are upregulated in a wide range of tumors, and their pharmacological activation induces apoptosis. Targeting TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-R) has emerged as a critical therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Despite some evidence for preclinical activity with past and present TRAIL-R agonists, only limited clinical efficacy has been reported so far, likely due to insufficient TRAIL-R clustering, decoy receptor binding, and hepatotoxicity. To address these limitations, M0674 has been designed as a trispecific antibody that simultaneously binds to tumor-associated (TA) MUC1, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 but not to TRAIL decoy receptors.Methods:We conducted a detailed pharmacological characterization of M0674 compared to other TRAIL-R agonists through in vitro and in vivo studies. Apoptosis and viability assays were performed on cancer cells and human hepatocytes. The antitumor activity of M0674, both as a monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy and an anti-CEACAM5 ADC with an exatecan payload (M9140), was evaluated using cell line-derived (CDX) and patient-derived (PDX) xenograft models.Results:Treatment with M0674 results in potent TA-MUC1-dependent induction of apoptosis and inhibition of viability in cancer cell lines, while human hepatocytes remain unaffected. M0674 demonstrates superior antitumor activity compared to other TRAIL-R agonists in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In vivo models show strong antitumor effects, including regressions, when M0674 is combined with systemic and targeted chemotherapies. MUC1-dependent single-agent activity and combination benefits with docetaxel are observed in three out of five nsqNSCLC PDX models that do not respond to docetaxel alone. Additionally, five out of six PDAC PDX models exhibit a strong combination benefit of M0674 with gemcitabine. Furthermore, the combination of M0674 with the anti-CEACAM5 ADC M9140 induces complete regression in a gastric CDX model.Conclusion:M0674 induces tumor-specific hyperclustering of TRAIL-R1 and R2 by binding to TA-MUC1, effectively triggering apoptosis in tumor cells without affecting healthy cells. The robust preclinical antitumor activity across various cancer types highlights the potential of M0674 as a safe and effective combination partner for systemic chemotherapies and ADCs.Citation Format:Christina Esdar, Doreen Musch, Carolin Sellmann, Ana Hecht, Achim Doerner, Enrico Guarnera, Julian Kreis.

    "abstract": "Claudin 6 (CLDN6) is a tight junction protein that is highly expressed in various human cancers, including ovarian and endometrial cancers, while it is not found in normal adult tissues. Claudin 9 (CLDN9), which shares significant homology with CLDN6, displays similar expression patterns, being nearly absent in normal tissues but upregulated in ovarian and endometrial cancers. We propose to target both CLDN6 and CLDN9 simultaneously to enhance anti-tumor efficacy and broaden treatment options for more patients. We successfully discovered an antibody that binds with high affinity to CLDN6 and CLDN9 while sparing other claudin family members. The humanized version of this candidate antibody demonstrates stronger binding and higher internalization compared to a benchmark antibody currently in clinical development. BLB-101 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) candidate featuring a topoisomerase-inhibitor-based payload optimized in-house with a proprietary hydrophilic linker. Design features of the linker enable efficient delivery of hydrophobic drug payloads and low likelihood of off-target endocytosis. BLB-101 has drug-to-antibody ratio of 8 (DAR8), demonstrates enhanced potency, favorable in vivo PK, and excellent plasma stability. In vitro studies revealed that BLB-101 ADC quickly internalizes in CLDN6+ or CLDN9+ cancer cells. BLB-101 exhibited strong cytotoxic effects across several cancer cell lines, including PA-1 and JEG-3. In addition, we confirmed the bystander killing effect of BLB-101 under a coculture condition of CLDN6-positive cells and negative cells in vitro. Furthermore, BLB-101 maintains the mAb's capability to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In xenograft models expressing CLDN6, BLB-101 treatment led to a substantial reduction in tumor size. Additionally, repeated administration of BLB-101 was well tolerated in both mice and in non-human primates. Together, these findings provide strong support for the continued development of BLB-101directed against CLDN6/CLDN9 positive tumors.Citation Format:Suk Hyung Lee, Alice Juang, Aastha Jain, Jun Liu, Wen Zhang, Zuoan Yi, Darren Buchwald, Alice Chen.

    "abstract": "Background:Metastatic brain tumors are common, especially in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and lead to poor prognosis. Current drug therapies are unsatisfactory, and the development of new drugs is needed. TROP2 is overexpressed in various cancers and an attractive target molecule in breast cancer. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting TROP2 and designed to selectively release the payload in the tumor cell via a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker. Dato-DXd has demonstrated preliminary intracranial activity in patients, but its pharmacodynamics in brain metastases is not yet clarified. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and payload distribution of Dato-DXd and sacituzumab govitecan (SG), another TROP2-directed ADC that was designed to be cleaved by hydrolysis which may result in gradual payload release in blood circulation and the tumor, in a mouse brain metastasis model of TNBC.Methods:We prepared a brain metastasis model by transplanting luciferase-expressing TROP2-positive TNBC cells into the brains of nude mice. To characterize ADC in treatment against intracranially transplanted tumors, the antitumor activity by measuring chemiluminescence and the concentration of the payload in tumors after intravenous administration of Dato-DXd were compared with those of SG.Results:Chemiluminescence showed that Dato-DXd administered at 10 mg/kg on Day 1 significantly reduced tumor size in the brain metastasis model compared with SG administered at 10 mg/kg on Days 1 (average -99.5% vs. -1.8%, p=0.02). Median survival was 18 days (95% confidence interval [CI]; 14-not assessed [NA] days) in control group, 48 days (15-NA days) in SG group, and 83 days (49-NA days) in Dato-DXd group. The DXd payload from Dato-DXd was rarely detected in the serum (Lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] of DXd: 0.01 ng/mL), while the SN-38 payload from SG was gradually increased (LLOQ of SN38: 0.015ng/mL). After administration of Dato-DXd, the payload in the tumor was accumulated and maintained, whereas the payload concentration gradually decreased in SG group (the area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] of the payload: 320.9 vs. 161.8 ng*hr/g). In contrast, the AUC of the payload in normal brain after administration of Dato-DXd was significantly lower than that after administration of SG (13.7 vs. 48.5 ng*hr/g).Conclusion:In this mouse model of brain metastases, Dato-DXd showed more potent antitumor activity against intracranially transplanted tumors of TNBC with higher accumulation of the payload in tumors compared with SG. The dosing utilized in this model does not directly correlate with human dosages, necessitating caution in interpreting the study results. This study warrants further clinical evaluation of Dato-DXd in TNBC patients with brain metastases.Citation Format:Chikako Funasaka, Hiroki Takashima, Daisuke Okajima, Tsuyoshi Karibe, Takanori Maejima, Satoru Yasuda, Toru Mukohara, Toshihiko Doi, Masahiro Yasunaga.

    "abstract": "Nectin-4-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) linked with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for metastatic bladder cancer. In combination with pembrolizumab, this therapy has doubled overall survival compared to conventional platinum-based chemotherapy. However, challenges such as drug toxicity and the accumulation of resistance to MMAE limit its therapeutic potential. In this study, we introduce a novel Nectin-4-targeted gene therapy strategy employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This advanced gene-editing tool, known for its precise induction of double-strand DNA breaks, was adapted to create over 50 random double-strand breaks (referred to as MT50) in target cells, leading to apoptotic cell death. To address the critical challenge of delivering gene-editing tools efficiently and specifically to cancer cells, we developed a highly efficient nucleic acid encapsulation system with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle. This platform demonstrated high nucleic acid encapsulation efficiency, exceeding 60% for plasmids (\u223c1 kb) and 80% for shorter RNAs, such as siRNA. The system was further optimized for encapsulating CRISPR/Cas9 components, including guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 mRNA. The T24 bladder cancer cell line, characterized by high Nectin-4 expression, was used as the experimental model. In vitro experiments demonstrated that MT50 delivery via Nectin-4-conjugated PLGA nanoparticles inhibited cellular proliferation by over 70%. In vivo, the nanoparticles were administered systemically through intraperitoneal injection into a murine model bearing T24 bladder cancer tumors. Tumor volume decreased by 70% following MT50 treatment, with significant downregulation of Nectin-4 expression observed in treated tumors compared to controls. While this experiment was conducted in immunocompromised mice, precluding the assessment of immunogenic cell death or synergistic effects with immune checkpoint inhibitors, we anticipate enhanced anti-tumor efficacy in immunocompetent models. Specifically, combining MT50 treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is expected to amplify therapeutic outcomes. This study highlights the successful development of a Nectin-4-targeted PLGA nanoparticle system capable of efficiently encapsulating and delivering CRISPR/Cas9 components to bladder cancer cells. The MT50 delivery system demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, offering a promising alternative to MMAE-linked ADCs. By circumventing cumulative resistance and leveraging the precision of gene editing, this approach has the potential to redefine bladder cancer therapeutics.Citation Format:Seung-hwan Jeong, Seokbong Hong, Hyeong Dong Yuk, Cheol Kwak.

    "abstract": "Context:Clinical trials are one of the major barriers in contemporary drug development. Functional assays based on patient-derived organoids (PDO) are a promising new tool for derisking clinical development of new therapies, but their use has been limited due to small cohort sizes and the absence of systematic validation studies. Using the largest cohort of matched PDOs, longitudinal clinical data, transcriptomic and WES data, we explore the use of large PDOs collections to characterize ADC efficacy and affinity with the targeted cells through systematic mapping of the relationship between target antigen abundance and payload efficacy.Methods:We have assembled a matched collection of PDOs and transcriptomic data from 135 colorectal (CRC) and pancreatic (PDAC) cancer patients, generated from primary tumour samples and metastatic biopsies. Patients ranged from 31 to 89 years old and had experienced an average of 2.6 lines of treatment prior to the PDO-generating tissue sampling. We used gene expression levels of well-known target antigens such as CEACAM5, HER2, and TROP2 as proxies for protein expression. This data is combined with PDO responses to microtubule and topoisomerase inhibitors, thereby enabling us to explore the relationship between target antigen abundance and payload efficacy. This allows us to generate data-driven hypothesis that were then validated in vitro on a pool of CRC and PDAC PDOs.Results:We identify patient subgroups by combining the RNA expression level and payload efficacy for ADCs against HER2 and CEACAM5. We systematically matched the RNA expression levels and histology for the corresponding proteins. Then we confirmed the response of the PDOs extracted from the tumors of these patients in vitro. We report that large-scale PDO-based assays can be a useful tool to anticipate clinical readouts. This work suggests that well-characterized PDO collections could also help redefine patient populations, increasing the likelihood of identifying those more likely to respond to a given ADC, and thus improving the success rates of clinical studies for new treatments in CRC and PDAC.Citation Format:L\u00e9lia Polit, Gizem Altay, Mia Cabantous, Anna-Rose Gryspeert, J\u00e9rome Cartry, Jacques RR.

    "abstract": "Purpose:To develop a treatment for HER2 positive patients whose tumors have stopped responding to EnhertuMethods:HER2 positive BT474 breast cancer cells were induced to become Herceptin resistant (trastuzumab resistant) in vitro via prolonged exposure to sub-lethal levels of the drug. Analysis of the trastuzumab-resistant cells showed that they had greatly increased expression of MUC1*, known to have anti-apoptotic and pro-growth properties. Recall that MUC1* (muk 1 star) is a growth factor receptor created after cleavage and release of the N-terminal portion of MUC1. The targeting antibody, huMNC2, has already demonstrated safety and cancer selectivity in a 1st-in-human CAR-T clinical trial for treatment of metastatic breast cancers. MNC2 is an IgG1 antibody that only recognizes the conformational epitope created when MUC1 is cleaved by specific tumor-associated enzymes. Confocal microscopy and pHrodo show that MNC2 is rapidly and robustly internalized by the cancer cells. We conjugated MNC2 to deruxtecan to yield an MNC2-deruxtecan with a DAR of 7.4. Female NSG mice were xenografted with either BT474-wt cells or the trastuzumab-resistant cells, BT474-Res2. Tumors were allowed to engraft then treated with trastuzumab or MNC2-deruxtecan.Results:Herceptin had little to no effect on BT474-Res2 implanted tumors. However, MNC2-deruxtecan potently killed the trastuzumab resistant tumors in a matter of weeks. MNC2 conjugated to other linker-payloads similarly killed the trastuzumab resistant tumors. Treated animals showed no obvious signs of toxicities.Conclusions:Patients with HER2 positive breast cancers have benefitted greatly from the new ADC Enhertu (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan). However, most patients, develop resistance to HER2-directed therapies and experience progressive disease leaving them with few treatment options. Here we\u2019ve shown that HER2 positive breast cancer cells acquire resistance to trastuzumab by increasing expression of the powerful growth factor receptor MUC1*. These MUC1*-targeting ADCs offer an effective treatment for these patients. These data support a conclusion that a MUC1*-ADC is safe and could have high therapeutic value for patients who have stopped responding to Enhertu.Citation Format:Cynthia C. Bamdad, Benoit J.

    "abstract": "Luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta; STRO-002) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) designed to target folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1)-positive cancers across a broad range of expression levels. It is composed of an anti-FR\u03b1 antibody conjugated to a tubulin-directed hemiasterlin payload via a protease-cleavable linker. The linker-payload is site-specifically conjugated via non-natural amino acids incorporated into the antibody sequence using Sutro\u2019s Xpress CF+\u00ae system, yielding a homogenous ADC with a drug-antibody ratio of four (DAR4). Preliminary results from Phase 1 and 2/3 studies in endometrial and ovarian cancer, respectively, show robust clinical activity and enhanced tolerability of luvelta as a single agent and in combination with bevacizumab. Here, we report preclinical data to support therapeutic targeting of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), for which there remains an unmet medical need, with luvelta.IHC staining of NSCLC patient tumor microarrays shows a prevalence of 48% and 14% FR\u03b1-positive tumors in non-squamous and squamous NSCLC tumors, respectively, as defined by \u22651% tumor cells with FR\u03b1 membrane staining at any intensity. In NSCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, luvelta treatment resulted in robust tumor growth inhibition, with best responses strongly correlating with FR\u03b1 levels. The majority of PDX models evaluated were EGFR wild type, but responses were also observed in some EGFR mutant models.An existing standard-of-care option for NSCLC is immunotherapy. ADCs and chemotherapeutic drugs have been shown to promote an inflamed tumor environment by triggering immunogenic cell death (ICD), which can synergize with immune checkpoint blockade. We provide evidence that luvelta is a potent inducer of ICD. In in vitro assays, luvelta induced all three hallmarks of ICD: HMGB1 release, ATP release, and surface expression of calreticulin. Furthermore, in in vivo vaccination studies, injection of luvelta-treated tumor cells established protective immunity against subsequent tumor challenge. Consistent with ICD induction, luvelta treatment in combination with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors resulted in enhanced in vivo efficacy in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Luvelta treatment in tumor-bearing mice also altered tumor immune cell infiltration and activation, demonstrating its ability to modulate the tumor immune microenvironment.In conclusion, the work presented here provides support for luvelta as a promising targeted therapy for NSCLC, either as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. Luvelta is now being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC (NCT06555263).Citation Format:Robert Yuan, Andrew McGeehan, Sihong Zhou, Mark Armanini, Jennifer Smith, Millicent Embry, Rhoneil Pena, Danielle K.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Mutations in the gene for human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) result in constitutive phosphorylation of the protein and are driver alterations in cancer. HER2 mutations are present at a frequency of 1% to 4% in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with exon-20 insertion mutations such as A775_G776insYVMA and G776delinsVC being among the most common of these latter mutations. Although HER2-targeted ADCs have shown marked efficacy for HER2 mutation-positive NSCLC, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying such efficacy are not well understood.Methods:The intracellular trafficking and dimerization patterns of HER2 were examined in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of the protein with the use of live cell imaging and an in situ proximity ligation assay, respectively. Proteins that preferentially associate with mutant HER2 were identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to shed light on the pathway of HER2 trafficking in HER2-mutated cells.Results:HER2 internalization was enhanced in NSCLC cells expressing mutant forms of HER2 compared with those expressing HER2(WT). Homodimers of HER2(WT) were localized mainly at the cell surface, whereas those of mutant HER2 were present mostly in the cytoplasm. Although siRNA interference of EGFR or HER3 effectively suppressed the HER2 internalization in cells stably expressing WT forms of HER2, such internalization was not affected in the cell lines expressing mutant forms of HER2. The enhanced internalization of mutant HER2 was mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, as was reflected by increased binding of the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to mutant HER2 and its consequent ubiquitination. Zongertinib, a HER2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, attenuated HER2 phosphorylation, the binding of c-Cbl to HER2, and HER2 internalization in HER2-mutated cells.Conclusions:Upregulation of HER2 phosphorylation promotes internalization of mutant forms of HER2 mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, which may contribute to the efficacy of HER2-targeted ADCs in NSCLC positive for HER2 mutations.Citation Format:Atsushi Shimauchi, Eiji Iwama, Ritsu Ibusuki, Hirono Tsutsumi, Daisuke Shibahara, Kohei Otsubo, Yasuto Yoneshima, Kentaro Tanaka, Hiroyuki Inoue, Isamu Okamoto.

    "abstract": "Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) represent an efficacious therapeutic modality. However, the classical payloads currently employed are limited in diversity, targeting mostly DNA, topoisomerases or tubulin and are sensitive to developing resistance. The high off-tumor toxicity observed with these payloads furthermore leads to a narrow therapeutic window. To overcome these challenges there is an urgent need for novel payloads that have a different mechanism of action and a more benign free-payload toxicity profile.Kinases play an essential role in the development and growth of many different cancers and thus form a target class of particular interest for novel payloads. To date, over 80 kinase inhibitors have been developed as therapeutic agents. The vast majority, however, lacks the potency required for an ADC payload. One of the main reasons for this is their inability to abrogate the scaffolding function of kinases, which is known to contribute to their oncogenic signaling. For this reason, heterobifunctional kinase degraders have gained interest. These are small molecules that mediate the degradation of a kinase-of-interest by the proteasome. Their catalytic functionality endows them with high potency. An ADC with a degrader-based payload is generally referred to as a Degrader Antibody Conjugate (DAC).We selected a cell cycle kinase that is known to be a tumor driver in many types of cancer. Knocking down this kinase using CRISPR technology is cytotoxic to many cancer cell lines representing major tumor indications (DepMap database). Using libraries of kinase ligands, spacers and E3 ligase ligands we identified degraders that rapidly and deeply degrade the kinase target and have potent antiproliferative activity in cancer cell lines, including those resistant to classical payloads. Degrader payloads were further selected for high microsomal lability, predicting rapid liver clearance, contributing to a more benign free payload toxicity profile. Mechanistic studies show that our lead degrader has a unique mode of action that results in complete cell cycle disruption, leading to DNA damage and potent immunogenic cell death.Our lead degrader was coupled to various maleimide-based hydrophilic linkers and conjugated to clinically validated antibodies to generate DACs. The high hydrophilicity of the linker-degrader combination allows for the generation of DACs up to DAR8 while retaining good monomericity and stability.Active DACs for various indications were generated, showing the wide applicability of our cell cycle kinase degrader-based payload. Our lead DAC for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) shows sub-nanomolar cytotoxic activity, potent target degradation, and effective bystander kill. The lead DAC was tested in a therapeutic in vivo xenograft model for prostate cancer and is currently progressing towards clinical development for mCRPC.Citation Format:Joost C.

    "abstract": "Background:Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a very aggressive subtype of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), for which therapeutic strategies are currently lacking. NEPC is rare de-novo (<1% of the cases) but can represent 15 to 20% of cases after failure of the treatment targeting the androgen receptor (AR) axis (such as enzalutamide, abiraterone) in. Carcinoembryogenic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) has been previously identified as an attractive NEPC cell surface antigen. Here, we investigate its expression in NEPC patient specimens and its therapeutic potential as a target for Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) therapy.Methods:Tumor biopsy specimens were obtained from the prospective trial MATCH-R (NCT02517892). Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were established and both patient biopsies (n=59) and PDX (n=16) were characterized by RNAseq and immunohistochemistry (IHC). 5 PDX from our 16 models were selected based on their CEACAM5 expression for our pharmacological assay: 2 NEPC models with a high expression of CEACAM5, 1 NEPC model with a mild (weak) expression of CEACAM5, 1 NEPC model with no expression of CEACAM5 and 1 mCRPC with a luminal phenotype and no expression of CEACAM5. SAR408701, an anti-CEACAM5 ADC or an irrelevant ADC with no specific target was administrated to immunodeficient mice. Tumor growth and body weight were monitored twice a week for 21 days post-injection.Results:54 patient biopsies were collected for IHC and 59 for RNAseq analysis. 33 cases out of the 54 presented evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation (in IHC analysis)tusamitamab and 21 expressed synaptophysin in more than 50% of the tumor cells. CEACAM5 expression in tumor cells was detected in 12 cases which all expressed synaptophysin (>50%), suggesting a strong correlation between CEACAM5 expression and neuroendocrine differentiation. An unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on RNAseq analysis of patient samples showed an enriched neuroendocrine cluster, in which CEACAM5 was significantly overexpressed. In the 5 PDX models selected to test the activity of Tusamitamab Ravtansine based on CEACAM5 expression, a strong correlation between CEACAM5 expression in the PDX models and response to Tusamitamab Ravtansine was observed, with Tusamitamab Ravtansine showing a strong antitumoral activity on CEACAM5 expressing PDX models and no efficacy in models lacking CEACAM5 expression.Conclusion:Overall, these results demonstrate the efficacy and specificity of SAR408701 against NEPC tumors harboring CEACAM5.This study provides preclinical evidence of the antitumor activity of SAR408701 in CEACAM5-positive NEPC.Funding:Gustave Roussy, Cancer Campus, Grand ParisCitation Format:Loic Poiraudeau, Bigot Ludovic, Cedric Pobel, Naoual Menssouri, Marine Aglave, Catline Nobre, Alice Bernard-Tessier, Natacha Naoun, Anna Patrikidou, Claudio Nicotra, Maud Ngocamus, Benjamin Besse, Karim Fizazi, Jean-Yves Scoazec, Anne-Marie Lefebvre, Celine Nicolazzi, Nathalie Mace, Anne-Laure Bauchet, Yohann Loriot.

    "abstract": "Background:Nectin-4 is a cell-adhesion molecule expressed in many solid tumors. Enfortumab vedotin (EV, PADCEV\u00ae), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting Nectin-4 with a monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload, is approved for the treatment of urothelial cancer (UC), which exhibits the highest Nectin-4 expression among all solid tumor types. To address the unmet medical need of UC patients who discontinue EV due to toxicity, lack of efficacy, or ineligibility for this approved therapy, and to expand Nectin-4 targeting in tumor indications with lower Nectin-4 expression beyond UC, we have developed IPH4502, a differentiated anti-Nectin-4 ADC conjugated to exatecan with a cleavable hydrophilic linker, and a drug-to-antibody ratio of 8.Methods:Nectin-4 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue-microarrays. Internalization was evaluated in vitro, and bystander effect was evaluated in vivo. In vivo studies were also conducted to evaluate anti-tumor activity using syngeneic mouse models, cell line-derived xenografts, and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from various indications.Results:IHC revealed that Nectin-4 is overexpressed in tumor tissues from several cancer types including but not limited to UC, esophageal cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and prostate cancer. IPH4502 demonstrates strong bystander killing effect in vivo, and high internalization efficiency in vitro in comparison to other Nectin-4 ADCs. These attributes contribute to enhanced anti-tumor activity in comparison to EV, across a spectrum of Nectin-4 expression levels, ranging from low to high expression, in PDX models. Moreover, IPH4502 shows efficacy in an in vivo model with primary resistance to MMAE due to MDR1 transporter expression and demonstrates anti-tumor activity in a PDX model of UC that acquired resistance to EV. Finally, IPH4502 shows activity in PDX models from indications beyond UC.Conclusion:The strong internalization and bystander effect of IPH4502 enable an efficient anti-tumor activity in Nectin-4 positive tumor models independent of Nectin-4 expression levels. In addition, IPH4502 shows efficacy in models resistant to EV, indicating that IPH4502 has potential for UC patients relapsing or refractory to EV treatment, as well as for cancer patients treated with MMAE-based ADCs. Finally, IPH4502 shows anti-tumor activity in various preclinical cancer models, including PDX models from different indications, supporting its development beyond UC.Citation Format:Romain Remark, C\u00e9cile Bonnafous, Laura Chiossone, Caroline Soulas, Cyril Perrier, Sivan Bokobza, Rachel Courtois, Julie Lopez, Gr\u00e9gory Fenaux, Olivier Benac, Barbara Carrette, Robin Letay-Drouet, Raja Bonifay, Marion Gaudin, S\u00e9verine Augier, L\u00e9a Simon, Agn\u00e8s Represa, Ariane Morel, Eric Vivier, Yannis Morel, Nicola Beltraminelli, Carine Paturel.

    "abstract": "Integrins are a large family of cell surface receptors with diverse roles in cellular adhesion, motility, and cytokinesis. Functional integrins exist as heterodimers consisting of single alpha and beta chains. Within this family, integrin beta-6 (IB6), which dimerizes exclusively with integrin alpha-v, is a target of interest in the clinic for its role in cancer. IB6 expression is low in normal adult epithelial tissues and high in solid tumors. In some cases, high IB6 expression has been demonstrated to be associated with poor prognosis such as in non-small cell lung, colorectal, gastric and cervical carcinomas. PF-08046876 is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of an anti-IB6 antibody conjugated to a camptothecin-class topoisomerase I (TOPO1) inhibitor, AMDCPT, using a traceless enzyme-cleavable glucuronide linker. The AMDCPT payload was optimized for potency, reduced susceptibility to MDR efflux pumps and enhanced bystander activity. PF-08046876 leverages the same antibody backbone from Sigvotatug Vedotin (SV) and is specific for IB6 but does not bind other alpha-v family members. In preclinical studies, PF-08046876 has demonstrated activity in vitro and in multiple in vivo models spanning a range of antigen expression levels in several solid tumor carcinomas including non-small cell lung, head and neck squamous cell, urothelial, and pancreatic carcinomas. PF-08046876 demonstrates a tolerability profile in non-human primates that is consistent with camptothecin ADCs. These results suggest that PF-08046876 is promising ADC for the treatment of multiple carcinomas and supports further clinical investigation. A Phase 1, first-in-human study is planned to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of PF-08046876.Citation Format:Rebecca C. Mazahreh, Narayana Yeddula, CB Lim, Gina LoMastro, Nicolas H.

    "abstract": "This work explores expression and therapeutic potential of RYK, a ROR-family receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) member, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Richter syndrome (RS). RYK belongs to a family of conserved proteins acting as alternative receptors/co-receptors of Wnt ligands. While the best-known member of the family, ROR1, has been targeted with various therapeutic modalities, little is known for RYK. RNA-sequencing data shows that RYK is expressed in CLL, RS, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma primary cells and malignant B cell lines of different developmental stages, as also confirmed both at mRNA and protein levels. Like ROR1, RYK expression was restricted to cancer cells, with undetectable levels in B, T, or NK cells, obtained from healthy donors. Given this pattern of expression, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) against RYK, SLV-404, was generated, consisting of a chimeric antibody targeting the extracellular portion of the receptor, a cleavable linker, and a cytotoxic agent, Dxd, an inhibitor of the topoisomerase I (TOP1) with a target drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of eight. Expression data showed that TOP1 is mainly expressed in cancer cells and tumor cells are uniquely sensitive to its inhibition.We then investigated in vitro apoptotic responses following SLV-404 treatment. After 72/96 hours of exposure, a marked apoptotic induction was observed by conventional flow cytometry assays (Annexin V/PI staining) and at the biochemical level by Western blot analysis of PARP1/Caspase 3 cleavage, XIAP reduction, and histone H2A.X phosphorylation. SLV-404 effects were then evaluated in vivo exploiting four established RS patient-derived xenograft models (RS-PDX) and a cell line-derived xenograft model, U-RT1. RS cells were initially injected subcutaneously and left to engraft. Mice were then randomly assigned to two different groups: vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) and SLV-404 (10 mg/kg), all treated by intravenous administration (iv), once a week for 3 weeks in total. SLV-404 significantly extended animal lifespan of 61 days (P<.04), 36 days (P<.02), 68 days (P<.02), 97 days (P<.01) and 47 days (P<.01), respectively for RS1316, RS9737, IP867/17, RS1050 and U-RT1.We then moved to a systemic model of RS, with leukemic cells injected iv and left to engraft 14 days before administering treatment once a week for 3 weeks in total. Disease spread was then evaluated by flow cytometry analysis of target organs, using tumor-specific human markers. Preliminary data confirm that treatment with SLV-404 resulted in dramatic decreases in RS cells to almost undetectable levels in all compartments, reaching statistical significance in spleen and bone marrow (P<.0001).Together, these results suggest that RYK is a novel tumor-associated antigen, making it a suitable ADC target. Moreover, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of a novel RYK-based ADC for the treatment of RS.Citation Format:Matilde Micillo, Beatrice Pirajno, Giulia Omezzolli, Amelia Fasc\u00ec, Nahal Nabelsi, Francesco E.

    "abstract": "Background:Resistance to single-agent cancer therapies often arises through complex mechanisms such as genetic mutations, compensatory signaling, and tumor microenvironment changes. These adaptive strategies make multi-drug combinations essential to effectively target canonical pathways simultaneously. However, common in vitro and in vivo models often fail to capture these complexities, resulting in limited translational success to human clinical settings. This highlights the need for predictive frameworks that not only identify synergistic drug combinations from human clinical trials, but also provide mechanistic insights to inform clinical application. This study presents a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that integrates extensive drug combination data with a knowledge graph to predict drug combinations with biological explainability.Methods:A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach was employed to enhance predictive specificity and reduce hallucinations. In vitro data on drugs, targets, cell lines, tumor types, and synergy scores were compiled from over 50, 000 cell line results from the DrugComboDb database. Using NCBI\u2019s APIs, BeautifulSoup, and GPT-4, biomedical information was extracted from 1, 092 phase I-III clinical trials covering 700+ drug combinations across 22 tumor types. This RAG corpus, combined with targeted prompts, fed into the LLM Mistral v0.2 for prediction generation, while a knowledge graph - PrimeKG provided mechanistic insights. Model validation included unseen cases (N=42) across various drug modality combinations (N=8), including 34 immuno-oncology therapies (IO) combined with an IO, chemo, or targeted therapy, 1 targeted therapy combination and 7 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) combinations.Results:The model achieved an F1 score of 0.80 on the entire validation set, with accuracy at 0.74, precision at 0.71, and recall at 0.92. Among drug modalities, combinations of ADC agents with IO/targeted/chemo/other ADC agents performed best (F1 score: 100%), while IO-IO combinations scored the lowest (F1 score: 62%). Each prediction included detailed mechanistic explanations, highlighting whether the drug combination was supported or unsupported with biological rationale.Conclusions:This study presents a novel framework integrating LLMs with biological knowledge graphs to predict the efficacy when combining 2-3 oncology drugs across a range of indications. By linking generative AI with explainability tools, we address two critical challenges in AI-driven drug discovery: predictive accuracy and mechanistic transparency. Such predictive models can accelerate the discovery of synergistic therapies, thereby reducing costly experiments, and improve overall patient outcomes. Specific test cases with explainable results will be presented.Citation Format:Han Si, Sanyam Kumar, Sneh Lata, Arshad Ahmad, Saurav Ghosh, Karen Stephansen, Deepti Nagarkar, Eda Zhou, Brandon W.

    "abstract": "Introduction.The FDA granted accelerated approval for trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors with HER2 3+. However, the role of HER2 in bladder cancer pathogenesis and its utility as a therapeutic target for this disease remains unclear. Here, we characterized a growing biobank of patient-derived organoid (PDO) and xenograft (PDX) models for HER2-targeted kinase inhibitor and ADC sensitivity, with the goal of guiding future therapeutic strategies for patients with bladder cancer.Methods.We generated and characterized the mutational status and HER2 expression levels of 19 urothelial cancer PDOs and 34 PDXs. A subset of these models was further characterized using a multiplatform approach, including single-cell DNA and RNA seq. We leveraged these models to study the biologic determinants of PDX sensitivity to neratinib and T-DXd. We also studied sensitivity to T-DXd, as well as to its cytotoxic payloads (exatecan) in vitro using paired PDO models. To understand the real-world clinical outcomes of T-DXd in metastatic urothelial carcinoma, we analyzed 28 patients treated with T-DXd at Memorial Sloan Kettering to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes and to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies.Results.Single-cell RNA and DNA seq analysis of 4 PDOs demonstrated high interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 expression and ERBB2 copy number. Our bladder cancer PDX models also demonstrated greater sensitivity to T-DXd than neratinib, consistent with clinical data in bladder cancer patients. Sensitivity to exatecan, as measured by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, was more predictive of T-DXd sensitivity than HER2 expression level. 3 patients remained on the treatment for more than 1 year, all of whom had an IHC score of HER2 3+ and ERBB2 amplification, suggesting HER2 3+ and ERBB2 amplification are predictive of but not required for clinical benefit with T-DXd.Conclusion.Multi-omic single-cell analysis demonstrated significant interpatient and intratumor heterogeneity of HER2 expression and ERBB2 copy number gain. Sensitivity to the T-DXd payload was more predictive of PDX response than HER2 expression levels, with significant tumor regression observed with T-DXd in models with low HER2 expression. Our data suggest that clinical trials of HER2-targeted ADCs should not be restricted to patients with HER2 overexpression and that novel biomarkers will be needed to identify those urothelial cancer patients most likely to benefit from FDA-approved and investigational ADCs. Real-world data from metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients treated with T-DXd suggested that HER2 3+ and ERBB2 amplification are associated with exceptional response to T-DXd treatment.Citation Format:Xinran Tang, Ziyu Chen, Jasmine Thomas, Karan Nagar, John Christin, Sizhi Gao, Jiaqian Luo, Elisa de Stanchina, Jonathan A.

    "abstract": "Bladder cancers display a wide spectrum of histologic phenotypes, the biologic basis and clinical implications of which remain poorly defined. Common histologic subtypes include squamous, glandular, micropapillary, plasmacytoid, small cell/neuroendocrine, sarcomatoid, and nested urothelial carcinoma (UC). Aside from the presence of CDH1 mutations as the pathognomonic alteration in plasmacytoid UC, DNA-based profiling studies failed to identify driver mutations specific to other histologic subtypes. To elucidate the molecular changes associated with phenotypic plasticity in mixed histology bladder cancer, we performed bulk RNA-seq of a large cohort of pure urothelial carcinomas (n=118, not otherwise specified, UC-NOS) and bladder tumors with divergent differentiation or histologic subtypes (n=199). This cohort included a subset of tumors in which RNA-seq was performed on macrodissected UC-NOS and variant histology regions of the same tumor. Our results showed that tumors with micropapillary, plasmacytoid and nested histology, which retain a urothelial-like transcriptional profile, also retain the expression of Nectin-4, Trop-2 and HER2, whereas other subtypes with histologic features of neuroendocrine, sarcomatoid, and squamous morphology exhibit lineage plasticity associated with lower or null expression of Nectin-4, Trop2, and HER2. Spatial transcriptomic sequencing of mixed histology tumors further confirmed that the expression of ADC targets including Nectin-4 and/or HER2 are often discordant between urothelial and variant regions of mixed histology bladder tumors. Furthermore, tumors with variant histology demonstrated a shorter duration of response to enfortumab vedotin (EV), an ADC targeting Nectin-4. Preliminary mechanistic investigation of Nectin-4 regulation using bladder cancer cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) has identified candidate driver genes which when inhibited revert lineage plasticity and increase the surface expression of Nectin-4, enhancing sensitivity to EV. Future studies with patient-derived models including organoids and xenografts will focus on identifying molecular targets whose inhibition leads to increased expression of Nectin-4 or other ADC targets such as HER2 and thus increased sensitivity of ADCs targeting these cell surface proteins. The long-term translational goals of these studies will be to identify rational combination strategies for enhancing the sensitivity to enfortumab vedotin in bladder cancer patients.Citation Format:Jiaqian Luo, Sizhi P.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a major modality of targeted cancer therapy, yet no ADC has been approved for colorectal cancer (CRC). LGR4/5/6 (leucine-rich repeat containing, G protein-coupled receptor 4, 5, 6) are three related receptors that are expressed at high levels together or alternately in nearly all cases of CRC. ADCs targeting LGR5 have been shown to have robust anti-tumor potency, but not all CRC cells express LGR5 and LGR5-positive tumor cells may lose LGR5 expression due to cancer cell plasticity. R-spondin 4 (RSPO4) is a natural protein ligand of LGR4/5/6 with high affinity for all three receptors. We fused a mutant form of RSPO4 that retains high affinity binding to LGR4/5/6 to IgG1 Fc to create a peptibody designated R462. Conjugation of R462 with a camptothecin analog (CPT2) at eight drugs per peptibody led to the synthesis of R462-CPT2 that showed highly potent cytotoxic activity in vitro in CRC cell lines expressing any of LG4/5/6. In cell line xenograft and PDX models of CRC, R462-CPT2 demonstrated robust anti-tumor effect. Importantly, R462-CPT2 showed no major adverse effect at therapeutically effective dose levels. These results strongly support the use of RSPO ligand drug-conjugates that target LGR4/5/6 simultaneously for the treatment of CRC.Citation Format:Yukimatsu Toh, Ling Wu, Jianghua Tu, Zhengdong Liang, Adela M.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the pancreas and occurs in the pancreatic duct in more than 90% of cases and is known as the 10th most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Recently, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumor microenvironment (TME) have been known to closely associate with progression of pancreatic cancer. Among TAMs, M2 type macrophages constitute the majority within the TME and are associated with tumor progression and drug resistance. Targeting M2 macrophages represents a promising therapeutic strategy to reprogram the TME and enhance anti-tumor immunity. In our previous study, we developed TB511, a peptide drug conjugate that preferentially binds to M2 macrophages and induces apoptosis through mitochondrial targeting by conjugating with dKLA. Furthermore, in pancreatic cancer, the nectin-4 expression has been known to contribute to tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and patient prognosis. Nectin-4 has been considered a potential new target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, therapeutic efficacy of anti-nectin-4 antibody has not been established in pancreatic cancer. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the combination therapy of TB511 and anti-nectin-4 antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in reducing tumor growth and modulating the immune cells of tumor microenvironment in a humanized pancreatic cancer mouse model. In this study, humanized mice bearing subcutaneous pancreatic cancer using the PANC1 cell line were treated with TB511, ADC, their combination, or PBS as a control. As a result, TB511, PADCEV, and their combination significantly reduced tumor growth and Ki67 expression. EMT marker analysis revealed increased E-cadherin and decreased vimentin expression in combination therapy groups. TB511 and combination therapy reduced M2 macrophages (CD163, CD18, Kim127, CD11b) and increased CD8 T cells in the TME, while ADC alone showed no significant immune modulation. Spatial transcriptomics highlighted decreased epithelial cancer cells, increased M1 macrophages, and elevated CD8 T and NK cells in the TB511 and combination groups. Immune checkpoint markers (CTLA4, FOXP3, LAG3) were downregulated, and cytotoxic markers (GZMB, IFNG) were upregulated with TB511 and combination therapy. No significant off-target effects were observed in the spleen, liver, lung, or brain. In conclusion, combination therapy with TB511 and ADC effectively suppresses pancreatic tumor growth and reprograms the immune microenvironment by decreasing M2 macrophages and enhancing cytotoxic T and NK cell responses, offering a promising strategy for pancreatic cancer treatment.Citation Format:Ik-Hwan Han, Ilseob Choi, Soyoung Kim, Juwon Yang, Heekyung Lee, Geumseong Yun, Hyunju Lee, Hyunsu Bae. 4775: Combination therapy with TB511 and anti-nectin-4 antibody drug conjugate in a human pancreatic cancer mouse model [abstract].

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:Cancer stem cells (CSC) are often drug-resistant and the source of recurrence; their destruction is a major therapeutic goal. LGR4/LGR5/LGR6 mark active stem cells and highly expressed in many solid cancers. Cymirafen consists of a human IgG1 Fc domain fused to the receptor-binding domains of RSPO1. The sortase reaction is used to site-specifically conjugate cleavable Gly3-val/cit-PAB-MMAE linkers to the C-terminal ends of the two chains through the formation of a highly stable peptide bond. We report here pre-IND studies that support the further development of cymirafen.METHODS:The protein component of cymirafen is constitutively produced by a stable CHO-K1 clone. Kd values were determined by ELISA using recombinant human and cynomolgus LGR5-His. In vitro growth rate inhibition assays used the CCK8 reagent. CDX models used SC implantation. Plasma cymirafen was measured by ELISA using antibodies to different RSPO1 epitopes for capture and detection. Free MMAE in plasma was determined by LC-MS/MS.RESULTS:Cymirafen binds to human and cynomolgus LGR5 with Kd of 0.27 and 0.38 nM, respectively. Its DAR is in the range 1.8-2.0. Across a panel of human cancer cell lines of multiple types, 76% had an IC50 of <10 nM, and in 36% IC50 was <5 nM. Against pairs of isogenic LGR5-low and LGR5-high OVCAR8 and HEK293 cells, cymirafen exhibited a 1.5 log differential IC50 in vitro. When grown as CDX, cymirafen was >2-fold more effective against OVCAR8/LGR5 than OVCAR8/EV. On a dose schedule of 85 mg/kg q7dx4, cymirafen was well tolerated in mice and active in CDX models of multiple types of cancer (colon, gastric, ovarian, neuroblastoma). Only 0.001, 0.002 and 0.013% of the MMAE was released from cymirafen in human, rat and cynomolgus plasma during 96 h at 37oC. MTD in mice is \u223c128 mg/kg. A dose-ranging study in rats identified a single dose STD10 of 75 mg/kg. Serum chemistries disclosed no organ dysfunction. Adverse events were limited to dose-related neutropenia > thrombocytopenia with recovery by two weeks at all doses. Initial and terminal plasma half-lives were 0.8 and 21.5 h; PK was close to linear over the range of 30 - 75 mg/kg. In SKNAS CDX tumors, cymirafen peaked at 4 h and remained above the IC50 value for this tumor for \u223c24 h.CONCLUSIONS:Cymirafen targets tumors with increased levels of LGR4, LGR5 and potentially LGR6, and co-receptors RNF43 and ZNRF3; an ADC can target only one receptor at a time. This favors greater control of drug resistance and recurrence. Unlike MMAE ADCs with long half-lives and cumulative toxicity, cymirafen delivers MMAE to tumors at high concentrations over a shorter period of time. It has a much higher normalized MMAE content than MMAE-containing ADCs. This permits administration of much higher doses on a well-tolerated weekly schedule. These features distinguish cymirafen from all MMAE ADCs and support its further development as a stem cell-targeted therapeutic.Citation Format:Maria Carmen Mulero Roig, Sukshala A.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with a poor five-year survival rate. The period of premalignancy is marked by structural and functional alterations in the epithelium that eventually progress to cancer. Epithelial stem/progenitor cells are essential for the maintenance and repair of the airway epithelium. Prior research from our group demonstrated a reduction in the function of normal progenitors in human lung premalignancy. However, studying progressive changes in the epithelium as it advances from normal to premalignant is challenging in humans. This led us to conduct a time-course study of urethane-induced lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) in mice to better understand the role of normal tissue stem cells in tumorigenesis.Methods:Tumorigenesis was induced in A/J mice (12 mice/group) by a single intraperitoneal injection urethane (1mg/gm), and control mice were injected with saline. Lung tissues were harvested at 2-, 4-, 10-, 16-, and 22-week post-injection; the left lobe was used for histological analysis, and the rest of the lung tissue was digested proteolytically to generate single-cell suspensions. Stem cell function was determined by organoid-forming assay, and molecular analysis of organoids was performed to identify genetic changes in stem cell populations.Results& Conclusions: Histological analysis revealed that the premalignant changes induced by urethane closely resembled the lesions observed in human lung ADC, including adenomatous hyperplasia, nodular hyperplasia, and adenoma. Immunofluorescence staining (IF) with cell type-specific markers to track the progression of these changes identified hyperplasia of club cells (CCSP+) at 2 weeks, followed by proliferation of type II (SPC+) cells, the formation of adenomas by 10 weeks, and the development of adenocarcinoma at 22 weeks. Quantification of organoids at all time points showed fewer organoids in urethane-treated mice compared to saline at 2 weeks, but the reverse was true at subsequent time points when greater numbers of organoids were made by the urethane-treated mice (p<0.01 for both directions). IF staining of organoids identified both airway and alveolar organoids, and there was no difference in their proportions between saline and urethane-treated mice. Interestingly, a small number of bronchoalveolar organoids containing both club and type II cells were detected exclusively in the saline-treated mice that were absent in the urethane group. Significantly, whole exome sequencing of organoids identified several oncogenic mutations in organoids from urethane-treated mice but did not detect mutation in Kras, the known driver for urethane-induced ADC. Thus, our results pointed to an early response of stem cells following urethane exposure, with notable shifts in their behavior during premalignant progression to cancer.Citation Format:Bridget K.

    "abstract": "High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung (hgNECs), which include small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and pulmonary large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), are characterized by poor prognoses, limited treatment options and rapid emergence of resistance. While recent surfaceome-directed approaches targeting DLL3, SEZ6, and TROP2 using chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts), bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) show considerable promise in hgNECs, novel strategies to target the heterogenous resistant disease are needed. AXL, a TAM family receptor tyrosine kinase, is known to mediate resistance to chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies in SCLC and other cancers, through its roles in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), DNA damage repair and replication stress tolerance. We hypothesize that targeting cell surface AXL would provide an effective therapeutic strategy in hgNECs, especially for relapsed disease. We analyzed the transcriptomic (bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing) and proteomic (immunohistochemistry) expression profiles of AXL in treatment-na\u00efve and relapsed SCLC, LCNEC and other extrapulmonary hgNECs patient tumors. High levels of AXL expression were seen in distinct tumor subsets. Notably, AXL-high tumors exhibited molecular signatures associated with resistance (higher EMT scores, lower replication stress and cisplatin response). To evaluate AXL as a viable surface target in hgNECs, we generated a preclinical CAR T cell against AXL. Anti-AXL CAR T cells were effective at inducing cytotoxicity in AXL-expressing SCLC and LCNEC cell lines. Similarly, an anti-AXL ADC also showed selective and potent cytotoxicity in AXL-positive models. These findings establish AXL as both a valuable biomarker and a promising target for the drug-resistant hgNECs, supporting the development of AXL-directed therapeutics such as anti-AXL CAR T cells and anti-AXL ADCs.Citation Format:Kavya Ramkumar, C.

    "abstract": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common pulmonary complication associated with cancer therapy. Several antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), including trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu), have been implicated in the induction of ILD, thereby limiting their clinical application. Treatment with ADCs must be permanently discontinued if grade 2 or higher ILD-related adverse effects occur. The standard approach for managing Enhertu-induced ILD involves the use of corticosteroids, which can exacerbate the toxicities faced by cancer patients. Our previous studies demonstrated that targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) enhances the efficacy of Enhertu and other ADCs in solid tumor treatment. Notably, we have now identified that FAK inhibition by the small molecule inhibitor Ifebemtinib (aka IN10018, Ifebe) can mitigate Enhertu-induced ILD. In an animal model of Enhertu-induced ILD, Ifebe showed recovery trends comparable to those observed with corticosteroids across multiple physiological parameters of mouse respiration. Both inflammatory and ILD injury biomarkers which were activated by Enhertu were significantly reduced with Ifebe monotherapy. Collectively, the combination of FAK inhibition and Enhertu may offer improved therapeutic efficacy while mitigating ILD-related toxicities. These findings warrant further clinical investigation.Citation Format:Baoyuan Zhang, Ran Pang, Jingwen Cheng, Jiaming Gao, Natasha Qin, Leo Liu, Zaiqi Wang.

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant public health challenge, with an urgent need of novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PTK7, a membrane tyrosine pseudokinase and Wnt receptor, is overexpressed in CRC and linked to poor prognosis. In CRC, PTK7 expression correlates with metastatic progression and decreased survival in non-metastatic patients, positioning PTK7 as both a potential biomarker and a promising drug target. Notably, a targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) against PTK7 has recently shown efficacy in inducing tumor regression in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of solid tumors and has progressed to a Phase I clinical trial with promising results. Other PTK7-targeting ADCs and anti-PTK7 CAR-T cells recently entered into preclinical development.At the plasma membrane, PTK7 can interact with a range of membrane receptors, including VEGFR, EGFR, ROR2, and Plexins, enhancing their signaling capabilities. Using biotin proximity labeling in HCT116 CRC cells, we identified a novel network of PTK7-associated membrane proteins. Among these, we focused on EPHA2, an active tyrosine kinase receptor also implicated in cancer. Our findings indicate that PTK7 and EPHA2 interact via their extracellular domains (ECDs), and that PTK7 depletion significantly upregulates EPHA2 expression and signaling in response to its ligand EFNA-1 in HCT116 cells. Additionally, PTK7 regulates EPHA2\u2019s endosomal sorting through a Rab11-dependent mechanism, as well as its K63-linked ubiquitination and subsequent lysosomal degradation. Mechanistically, PTK7 does not appear to participate directly in EFNA-1 binding but instead promotes multimerization of active EPHA2, a crucial step in amplifying EPHA2 signaling.This study aims to elucidate the functional role of the interaction between PTK7 and EPHA2 in colorectal cancer progression. By mapping the PTK7:EPHA2 interface using AlphaFold3 predictions and introducing targeted deletions and mutations within the ECDs of both receptors, we seek to understand how disrupting this interaction influences tumorigenic and metastatic processes. Our findings indicate that PTK7 depletion triggers cell rounding and detachment, with a marked increase in total and activated EPHA2 levels, which may drive pro-metastatic activity in vivo. Outcomes may significantly impact the use of anti-PTK7-ADCs or CAR-T cells and orient new therapeutic strategies to design agents interfering with PTK7 and EPHA2 interaction and function.Citation Format:Charlotte Dessaux, Constantin Semenchenko, Luc Camoin, St\u00e9phane Audebert, Emilie Baudelet, Avais Daulat, Flavio Maina, Jean-Paul Borg.

    "abstract": "Background:Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in various cancer types and has been reported to play key roles in promoting tumor progression. In this study, we investigated the subcellular expression, biological function, and potential therapeutic strategies targeting the ADAM10-APP axis in colorectal cancer (CRC).Methods:Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analysis were performed to elucidate the enrichment of APP expression in CRC. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) surfaceome analysis was conducted on 14 CRC cell lines to validate APP expression on the cell surface. A tissue microarray (TMA) was used to validate the surface expression of APP. Western blotting, 3D culture, invasion and migration assays, as well as a nude mouse model, were utilized to investigate the biological function of APP. Additionally, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) assay targeting APP was utilized to explore its therapeutic potential in CRC.Results:Multi-omics data revealed that APP is highly expressed in CRC and is specifically enriched in epithelial cells. Through proteomic profiling of human CRC cell lines and validation in a tissue microarray consisting of 140 CRC tumors, we identified APP as significantly enriched on the cell surface. Functional studies showed that knockdown or knockout (KO) of APP in CRC cells led to marked reductions in cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasiveness, effects that were in part reversible upon the addition of soluble APP (sAPP). In xenograft models of colorectal cancer (CRC), APP-KO HCT116 tumor-bearing mice exhibited significantly reduced tumor growth and tumor initiation frequency compared to control HCT116 tumor-bearing mice. We further demonstrated that treatment of CRC cells with GI254023X, a selective ADAM10 inhibitor, increased cancer cell surface APP expression. A combination therapy of GI254023X with an APP antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin F (APP-ADC-MMAF) resulted in superior anti-cancer efficacy compared to either treatment alone.Conclusion:APP is highly expressed on the surface of CRC cells and promotes tumor progression, making it a potential target for ADC therapies. Inhibition of ADAM10 reduces APP cleavage and further enhances its surface expression, highlighting a promising treatment strategy for CRC.Citation Format:Rongzhang Dou, Hanwen Xu, Ricardo A.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most common type of cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with 2.5 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths in 2022. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for \u223c15% of all lung tumors, representing the most aggressive high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with a five-year survival rate of less than 4%. The majority of patients are diagnosed with extensive stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) with brain metastases in \u223c80% of cases, yielding a grim 5-year survival rate of under 2%. Many patients experience relapse following front-line therapies, and current second-line treatment options remain limited. Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) is highly expressed in SCLC, neuroendocrine tumors, and glioblastoma with minimally or no expression in normal tissues, making it an attractive target for SCLC. B7-H3, an immunoregulatory protein, is overexpressed in several tumor types, including SCLC. Both DLL3 and B7-H3 are validated targets for SCLC. Tarlatamab, a T cell engager targeting DLL3, was recently approved for SCLC. ADCs targeting DLL3 have shown robust anti-tumor activities in clinical trials. Similarly, anti-B7-H3 ADCs have also shown promising clinical potential.We constructed a series of bispecific ADC (bsADC) that target both DLL3 and B7-H3 (DLL3xB7H3) simultaneously for SCLC and other tumors expressing these markers. We hypothesized that dual targeting could enhance selectivity and potency, address tumor heterogeneity in tumoral DLL3 and B7-H3 expression levels and allow a broader patient population for treatment. The bispecific antibody (bsAb) moieties of the bsADCs were designed in a1+1 format and were conjugated to a novel TOPO1 inhibitor payload with potent bystander effect (DAR 8) and a highly hydrophilic, enzyme-cleavable linker. In vitro, the bsAbs showed superior internalization in double positive cell lines than the parental monovalent arms and outperformed the naked antibodies of DS-7300 and rovalpituzumab (Rova). In vivo studies using a SCLC CDX model, the bsADCs demonstrated robust anti-tumor efficacy that was superior to DS-7300 ADC when conjugated to BLD-1102. The specificity of DLL3 targeting was validated in DLL3 negative CDX and PDX models in vivo. The bsAbs for our lead bsADCs exhibited excellent stability under stress conditions, suggesting their suitability for CMC development. In summary, our DLL3xB7H3 bsADCs showed promising and superior in vitro and in vivo preclinical activities with first-in-class potential for SCLC treatment.Citation Format:Kaiqing Zhang, Liu Yang, Peiran Li, Yu Qi, Jushi Gai, Luheng Du, Gao An, Chengzhang Shang, Yanan Guo, Yi Yang, Frank An.

    "abstract": "Background:Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan (T-Dxd, DS-8201), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting HER2, is clinically approved for cancer patients with high and low HER2 expression levels; however, the response rate to DS-8201 are modest, especially in gastric cancer and the mechanisms of resistance remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to address this gap by developing clinically DS-8201 resistant patient derived xenograft (PDX) models in gastric and breast cancer. Our objectives were to elucidate possible mechanisms of resistance with this topoisomerase inhibitor-linked HER2 ADC and explore whether combining DS-8201 with an anti-PD-1 antibody could overcome resistance by using a humanized mouse model.Method:Humanized mice were established by injecting human CD34 positive hematopoietic stem cells into NCG mice, followed by inoculation with PDX tissues from DS-8201-resisatnt gastric or breast cancer patients. Once tumors reached approx.150-200mm3, the mice were administered a single dose of DS-8201, pembrolizumab (twice weekly for 4 weeks) and a combination. Tumor samples were harvested 24h after the final dose, fixed with 10% NFB overnight, and subjected to IHC staining with antibodies targeting CD8, CD4 and HER2 to assess changes in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, DNA and RNA were extracted from tumor samples using the K-Cell\u00ae kit for subsequent whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis, respectively.Results:the data revealed limited tumor inhibition in DS-8201 treated group, consistent with clinical findings. Elevated expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, known as drug efflux pumps, was observed in this group, suggesting a potential strategy for overcoming resistance by targeting these transporters. Concurrent administration of pembrolizumab enhanced the efficacy of DS-8201, leading a significant inhibition in tumor growth compared to both the vehicle and monotherapy arms. An increase in CD3+ T cells in blood and CD8+/CD4+ T cell ratio was observed in the combination therapy group, suggesting modulation of the tumor microenvironment.In conclusion, the establishment of novel gastric and breast PDX cancer models, derived from patients exhibiting resistance to DS-8201 in clinical settings, provided a valuable approach for investigating mechanisms of resistance in HER2 targeted ADCs. Our findings suggest that combining pembrolizumab with ADC may represent a promising strategy for overcoming resistance by modulation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.Citation Format:Diandong Jiang, Bin Xie, Yulan Tang, Hongkui Chen, Xin Hou, Cui Xu, Dan Shao, Xinlei Chen, Xiaorong Gu, Loc Van, Josh Caggiula, Danyi Wen.

    "abstract": "Adoption of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved outcomes for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) by disrupting tumor-promoting growth factors, but patients develop resistance to these therapies through acquired alterations in other receptors. MET amplification is a common mechanism of resistance to FDA-approved small molecule EGFR inhibitors. Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), such as c-MET targeting telisotuzumab-vedotin, are emerging as a promising therapy for EGFR inhibitor-progressed NSCLC, but understanding ADC efficacy across diverse profiles of advanced tumors remains a challenge. There is a need to develop more translational preclinical models to understand next-generation experimental agent efficacy prior to clinical trial enrollment. Here, we investigate the therapeutic potential of an experimental anti-cMET ADC in a panel of NSCLC low-passage patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models derived from patients pre-treated with EGFR therapies.10 NSCLC PDX models from Champions Oncology\u2019s tumor bank were established In Vivo from patient tumors and maintained at a low passage. Genomic and pharmacologic profiling was conducted on established models to characterize EGFR resistance. Models were then treated with 1 or 3 mg/ kg experimental agent every 4 days for 8 doses, with tumor volume and survival data collected over a 4-week treatment period. The experimental anti-cMET ADC demonstrated a range of tumor growth inhibition across the selected models, which is reflective of the heterogeneity seen in NSCLC patients in the clinic. Several cMET-amplified models showed significant tumor regression, while other cMET-amplified models exhibited more variability ranging from partial response to full resistance to treatment. The use of low-passage NSCLC PDX models is essential in preserving the clonal heterogeneity and molecular landscape of patient tumors, making them highly relevant for the preclinical evaluation of novel therapies. Notably, Champions low-passage models preserved the molecular and histological features of the original patient tumors, including mutations and copy number variations, which were critical for understanding the response to therapy. Our study highlights the translational potential of Champions PDX models, serving as a platform for investigating the efficacy and mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies.Citation Format:Nathlie Leger, Kayla Tyskiewicz, Hanna Koster, Paul Heverly, Mara Gilardi, Stefano Cairo, Frank Smith.

    "abstract": "Background:The emerging field of biparatopic (bpADC) and bispecific antibody-drug conjugates (bsADC) provides an innovative therapeutic category combining the merits of ADCs and bispecific/biparatopic antibodies. Promise in the field stems from the ability of bsADCs to overcome the existing clinical challenges associated with ADCs, such as poor internalization, drug resistance, and off-target toxicity. To date, more than 10 bsADCs are undergoing clinical trials, including HER2\u00d7Trop2 BsADCs. HER2 is a well-established target for ADCs such as trastuzumab emtansine and trastuzumab deruxtecan, demonstrating significant clinical benefits in HER2-positive breast cancers. The human cell-surface trophoblast protein 2 (Trop-2) is overexpressed in a wide range of solid tumors, including HER2-low expressing tumors, with minimal expression in normal tissues. Trop-2-directed ADCs such as sacituzumab govitecan and datopotamab deruxtecan have demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in a broad range of solid tumors including patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer, lung cancers and urothelial cancers. The dual-targeting approach offered by bsADCs has the potential to increase tumor cell binding affinity and internalization, leading to enhanced payload delivery and better tumor efficacy.Methods and Results:We developed two different HER2\u00d7Trop-2 bispecific antibodies (Saci/Tras-hIgG1 and Dato/Tras-hIgG1) leveraging a monovalent bispecific IgG1 format, which is monovalent for each antigen based on the Fab fragments of trastuzumab, sacituzumab or datopotamab. The fully human anti-HER2/Trop-2 bispecific antibodies were conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a lysosomally cleavable linker to generate uniform HER2\u00d7Trop-2 bsADCs (Saci/Tras-vc-MMAE and Dato/Tras-vc-MMAE) with an average DAR of 4.2. The binding affinity and specificity of anti-HER2/Trop-2 bsADC was evaluated by ELISA and FACS, respectively. The bsAb-vc-MMAE conjugates exhibited greater tumor killing efficiency and specificity with an IC50 in sub nM level in cell lines with high Trop-2 expression and medium/low HER2 expression. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated antitumor activity with improved efficacy compared to monotherapy ADCs targeting either HER2 or Trop-2 alone, with favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles.Conclusion:HER2\u00d7Trop2 bsADCs represent a novel and exciting class of therapeutic agents with the potential to transform the treatment of multiple cancer types. Preclinical studies of HER2\u00d7Trop2 bsADCs have demonstrated that bsADCs can effectively inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival in xenograft animal models, with a favorable safety profile and low incidence of severe adverse events.Citation Format:Daniel He, Greg Liang, Haixia Chen, Mingqi Shao, Songyan Huang, Qiong Wang, Yinfei Yin, Qikuan Chen.

    "abstract": "Background:Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the one of the most challenging cancers with unmet medical needs. Cadherin 17 (CDH17) is a membranous cell adhesion molecule. It is frequently overexpressed in CRC and several other gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, with limited expression in normal intestinal tissue and pancreatic duct. The differential expression profile in tumor versus normal tissue makes it an attractive target for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in GI cancers, particularly CRC. MRG007 is a CDH17-targeting ADC consisting of a novel humanized IgG1 antibody site-specifically conjugated with the cytotoxin Exatecan using Synaffix\u2019s GlycoConnectTM technology with a well-balanced DAR value. This differentiated drug design will potentially improve anti-tumor efficacy and broaden the therapeutic window.Materials and Methods:The biological activity and safety profile of MRG007 were investigated in a series of preclinical studies, including (1) binding ability to CDH17 expressed on GI cancer cells as well as rhesus CDH17 evaluated by flow cytometry; (2) internalization rate in GI cancer cells evaluated by pHAb Reactive Dye labeling; (3) in vitro cytotoxicity against a panel of GI cancer cell lines; (4) anti-tumor activity evaluated in several GI cancer cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and CRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models with different levels of CDH17 expression; (5) plasma stability evaluated in human, rhesus, rat and mouse plasma; (6) an exploratory pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicology study in rhesus monkey.Results:MRG007, the CDH17-targeting ADC, and its antibody moiety showed strong binding activity to CDH17 expressed on a panel of GI cancer cell lines. Similar binding potency to both human and rhesus monkey CDH17 makes rhesus monkey suitable for toxicological evaluation. Rapid internalization of MRG007 was observed in a panel of CDH17-expressing GI cancer cells, and MRG007 maintained comparable internalization efficiency to the naked antibody. MRG007 demonstrated efficient and CDH17-dependent cytotoxic activity in a panel of GI cancer cells expressing varying levels of CDH17. MRG007 exhibited a robust and dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in multiple GI cancer CDX and CRC PDX mouse models with varying levels of CDH17 expression, which was significantly better than GGFG-DXd DAR8 ADC conjugated with the same naked antibody. Remarkable stability of MRG007 was shown in the plasma of various species tested with minimal payload release and stable DAR value. MRG007 demonstrated a favorable PK and safety profile with good tolerability in the exploratory toxicology study.Conclusion:Overall, the preclinical study results suggest that MRG007 is a differentiated and potent ADC drug candidate for the treatment of CDH17-expressing cancers in clinical trials.Citation Format:Peng Zeng, Qi Wu, Yongjun An, Yili Feng, Yanchun Wang, Shoujia Liu, Deliang Li, Feifei Cui, Lei Fang.

    "abstract": "Background:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as highly effective new therapeutics for metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), an anti-TROP2 ADC, has been approved for the treatment of ER+/HER2- and triple negative mBC and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), an anti-HER2 ADC, has been approved for HER2-amplified and HER2-low mBC. Despite the significant improvement in patients\u2019 survival, several hurdles remain to overcome, including the development of predictive biomarkers and the optimal sequential strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to SG and T-DXd ADCs in PDX models established from mBC and to identify potential biomarkers of response and resistance.Material and Method:Biopsies from metastases or breast tumors from stage IV patients progressing on standard of care treatments were engrafted in nude mice. PDX were characterized at the genomic level and by RNAseq. HER2 expression was scored by IHC analysis by a clinical pathologist. The anti-tumor efficacy of T-DXd and SG was tested in vivo on 20 and 8 PDX respectively as compared to standard care treatment (endocrine therapy, CDK4/6 inhibitors, PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy).Results:Forty-two PDXs were established, 33 (79%) from metastases and 9 (21%) from breast tumors of mBC. At the genetic level, PDX exhibited the typical molecular pattern of mBC with frequent alterations in the PIK3CA, AKT1, ESR1 and FGFR1 genes. Both T-DXd and SG treatment resulted in strong anti-tumor activity in multiple PDX, with 70 % and 75% of the models showing partial or complete response, respectively. Most of the models show similar responses to T-DXd and SG, with few PDX showing a different response pattern. Among these, a BRCA1 mutated PDX showing cross resistance to talazoparib, CDK4/6 inhibitor, chemotherapy and T-DXd, was found to be a highly responder to SG treatment. T-DXd and SG were also highly efficient in ESR1 mutated PDX established from patients progressing on aromatase inhibitors, including a model with cross resistance to different SERD. HER2 expression at baseline did not predict response to T-DXd. GSEA analysis identified different gene sets associated with T-DXd resistance, including KRAS signaling, EMT and hypoxia. Pharmacodynamic experiments in PDX responder and resistant to T-DXd and SG are ongoing to identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers.Conclusionand Perspective: In summary, we established PDX of mBC, characterized for HER2 expression, genomic alterations and response to T-DXd and SG. Both ADCs showed high anti-tumor activity in multiple PDX with resistance to standard treatments including CDK4/6 inhibitors, SERD and PARP inhibitors. Response to T-DXD was not correlated with HER2 expression while T-DXd resistance was associated to an enrichment of EMT and hypoxia gene sets.Citation Format:Elodie Montaudon, Rania El Botty, Helo\u00efse Derrien, Ahmed Dahmani, Laura Sourd, Gabriel Champenois, Andr\u00e9 Nicolas, Didier Meseure, Guillaume Dutertre, Anne Vincent-Salomon, Laura Courtois, Julien Masliah Planchon, Ivan Bi\u00e8che, Florence Coussy, Luc Cabel, Elisabetta Marangoni.

    "abstract": "Ly6E (lymphocyte antigen 6 family member E) is a GPI anchored cell surface protein frequently expressed in a number of cancers such as TNBC, NSCLC, HNSCC, ESCC, OVCA, and PDAC, with minimal presence in normal tissues. ZW327 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting human Ly6E, composed of a humanized IgG1 antibody bearing Fc-silencing mutations, conjugated to a novel camptothecin-based topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, ZD06519, via a maleimide anchor and a glycyl glycyl phenylalanyl glycine (GGFG)-aminomethyl (AM) cleavable linker with DAR8. The antibody was discovered from animals immunized with Ly6E HEK293 transfected cells, utilizing proprietary B-cell culture-based technology followed by humanization. Antibody binding to human and cynomolgus monkey Ly6E was evaluated by KinExATM and flow cytometry. To understand therapeutic potential of ZW327, antibody internalization was assessed by flow cytometry in several Ly6E-expressing tumor cell lines and in vitro cytotoxicity of ADC was assessed in tumor spheroids using a panel of breast, lung and other tumor cell lines. Tumor spheroid penetration of ZW327 was also investigated, as well as tumor cell co-culture assays performed to assess bystander-mediated cell killing by ZW327. Developability was assessed utilizing methods such as, NS-ELISA, AC-SINS, cIEF, LC/MS and UPLC-SEC, under normal and stressed conditions. Anti-tumor activity of ZW327 and PK were investigated in a number of xenograft mouse models representing a range of Ly6E-expression. ZW327 antibody was successfully humanized and demonstrated low nanomolar binding affinity to both human and cynomolgus monkey Ly6E, as well as strong binding to target-expressing tumor cell lines. Robust internalization of ZW327 antibody was observed in Ly6E-expressing tumor cell lines, as well as spheroid penetration and ADC exhibited potent and target-specific cytotoxicity in a panel of breast, lung and other tumor cell spheroids. The antibody binding, internalization and spheroid penetration were all superior to the hu9B12.v12 clinical benchmark antibody and ZW327 exhibited pronounced cytotoxicity when compared to DLYE5953A clinical benchmark ADC. ZW327 showed good bystander-mediated killing of Ly6E-negative cells when co-cultured with target positive tumor cells. A single administration of ZW327 resulted in tumor regression across xenograft models and demonstrated a favorable PK profile. Overall, these results support the potential of ZW327 as a novel therapeutic agent against Ly6E-bearing cancers.Citation Format:Dunja Urosev, Saki Konomura, Michael Lee, Germanna Righetto, Elizabeth Porter, Katina Mak, Ambroise Wu, Amos Chua, Linglan Fu, Diego Alonzo, Spencer Boisjoli, Edward Lau, Janice Tsui, Vidhi Khanna, Alex Wu, Devika Sim, Mark E.

    "abstract": "Background:Anti-cancer treatments can range from systemic therapy, like chemotherapy, to targeted approaches, such as antibody-drug conjugates. In any case, such therapies cause adverse events (AEs) in cancer patients. In this study, we have developed a dedicated knowledge graph (KG) for AE risk factor prediction - SafetyNet. Specifically, this study aims to deliver class-specific risk factors, inform toxicity management guidance, and elicit a strategy for risk mitigation and monitoring. Ultimately, we aim to devise a standardized framework to monitor AEs in clinical trials.Methods:SafetyNet was built from synthetic data of 21 oncology trials, which was created from and follows the same distribution as AstraZeneca trial data and is therefore a suitable interim substitute. Real ADC trial data will replace the synthetic data in the near future. In addition, SafetyNet includes biomedical entities and relationships from AstraZeneca\u2019s internal Biological Insights Knowledge Graph, with prior knowledge from literature as well as safety intelligence data from OFF-X. We find trends in the data by querying SafetyNet via the personalized PageRank (PPR) method. Briefly, PPR works by simulating multiple random walks in the graph, from which we count the number of visits to each node. Nodes that are visited more often have higher PPR, meaning they are more important to the starting node.Results:There are different strategies that can be employed to obtain insights. We can, for example, focus on a given AE: for patients that had nausea as an AE of the primary treatment, we found hypertension to be the most frequent comorbidity, with 367 patients affected. To complement this observation, we found that there are 543 concomitant medications that have both nausea and hypertension as a known AE. We can also analyze trends between serious and non-serious cases of a given AE: serious vomiting was more tightly linked to the use of tinzaparin sodium, an antithrombotic drug. Accordingly, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis were more frequent in patients experiencing serious vomiting vs non-serious. We can equally analyze patients that had a particular concomitant medication: diarrhea, nausea and vomiting were all higher ranked in patients that were taking cisplatin concomitantly with the primary treatment.Conclusions:By utilizing SafetyNet, we can identify the risk factors associated with AEs for a given ADC as well as their relationship with concomitant medications. By doing these analyses across ADC trials, we gain generalized insights that can help our understanding of AEs in the ADC space. In turn, these insights can be used to create standardized guidelines for ADC toxicity guidance and AE monitoring. Furthermore, SafetyNet brings considerable time saving and human error reduction relative to manually analyzing all the clinical, literature and OFF-X data.Citation Format:Miguel Goncalves, Mark O\u2019Donoghue, Abigail Morrison, Heidi Lloyd-Williams, Sanjana Singarayer, Neki Patel, Samad Jahandideh, Ken Twomey, Krishna C.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic dysregulation contributes to the development and progression of various cancers. Enhancer of zeste homolog (EZH)2 and EZH1 are enzymes that promote trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a repressive transcriptional mark associated with gene silencing. Valemetostat tosylate (valemetostat; DS-3201) is a first-in-class, oral, dual inhibitor of EZH2 and EZH1 that has demonstrated a greater potential to reduce H3K27me3 than EZH2-selective inhibitors and has strong antitumor activity in in vitro and in vivo studies. Dual inhibition of EZH2 and EZH1 could potentially alter the expression of genes involved in drug sensitivity and resistance in cancer cells, making valemetostat a candidate for combination therapies with established agents. This study assessed the preclinical activity of valemetostat combined with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd; DS-8201), a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), and with datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd; DS-1062), a trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed ADC. Both T-DXd and Dato-DXd include a plasma-stable, selectively cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload (DXd, an exatecan derivative). The combined effects of valemetostat with DXd was tested in vitro in breast cancer (BC) and gastric cancer (GC) cell lines. Changes in the expression of various proteins and gene signatures were assessed by Western blot and RNA-sequencing analysis. The combined effects of valemetostat with each DXd-ADC were examined in in vivo mouse models bearing BC, GC, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. In vitro, valemetostat enhanced cell-killing activities of the DXd payload in BC and GC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Valemetostat upregulated the expression of Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) and HER2, in multiple HER2-low BC cell lines, and increased phosphorylation of H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, in a GC cell line. Gene signature analysis revealed that valemetostat reduced DNA damage response (DDR) signatures and increased major histocompatibility complex (MHC) signatures in BC, GC, and NSCLC in vitro models. Furthermore, valemetostat enhanced in vivo antitumor activities of T-DXd and Dato-DXd in human tumor xenografted models. Results from in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that valemetostat potentiates the antitumor effect of DXd-ADCs via multiple cellular mechanisms, including increased expression of SLFN11, neoantigen presenting molecules (eg, MHC), ADC targets (eg, HER2), and reduced expression of genes involved in the DDR. A phase 1b, open-label, Master Protocol trial is currently investigating the clinical safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of valemetostat in combination with T-DXd and Dato-DXd in patients with various solid tumors (NCT06244485).Citation Format:Daisuke Honma, Akiko Toyota, Yasuhiro Hama, Yasuki Kamai, Daisuke Okajima, Yoshiyuki Hizukuri, Maiko Narahara, Yuka Yamamoto, Emi Nosaka, Katsuki Usami, Kazumi Sato, Hiroki Goto, Ayumi Tezuka, Ayako Kato, Chisa Wada, Naoya Wada, Megumi Minami, Hideki Kobayashi, Mayumi Kitagawa.

    "abstract": "Overexpression, amplification or mutation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is observed in up to 30% of solid tumors resulting in increased downstream signaling and oncogenic transformation. While trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) recently approved for HER2 altered cancer types, has resulted in improved outcomes there remains a substantial unmet need for patients who either progress on T-DXd or discontinue treatment due to adverse events. The advent of small molecule HER2 inhibitors represents an opportunity to provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to these patients either as a single agent or in combination. However, given the structural similarities between EGFR and HER2, most small molecule HER2 kinase inhibitors are dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. These inhibitors often face significant dose-limiting toxicities related to EGFR, which hinder their clinical utility. ELVN-002 is a potent irreversible HER2 inhibitor with > 100-fold selectivity over EGFR currently undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with HER2 alterations both alone and in combination with approved standard of care therapies. We evaluated the effect of ELVN-002 and other clinically-relevant HER2 small molecule inhibitors on HER2 cell surface expression and internalization in HER2 positive cell lines derived from patients with either gastric cancer or breast cancer. We determined that ELVN-002 reduces HER2 expression on the cell surface but had no effect in total HER2 expression. Further, HER2 degradation was quantified by measuring ubiquitinated HER2. We discovered that upon ELVN-002 treatment, HER2 ubiquitination and internalization was significantly increased compared to control cells. In contrast, treatment with other clinically-relevant HER2 inhibitors did not increase HER2 internalization. Reduced cell surface HER2, in conjunction with enhanced HER2 degradation suggest that ELVN-002 induces greater HER2 receptor flux at the cell surface. ADCs bind their target and are subsequently degraded in the lysosome, resulting in the intracellular release of their toxic payload. However, some intact ADCs escape degradation via endocytic recycling. The increase in ubiquitinylated HER2 upon treatment with ELVN-002 suggests ELVN-002 enhances the amount of HER2 targeted to the lysosome and would therefore increase the amount of payload released relative to untreated cells. In contrast, treatment with other HER2 inhibitors results in increased cell surface HER2 retention and decreased internalization suggesting a decrease in cytotoxic payload deposition if combined with an ADC. The differentiated profile and mechanism of ELVN-002 has the potential to be a superior treatment in HER2 expressing cancers in combination with ADCs, other modalities, and as a single agent.Citation Format:Amanda J.

    "abstract": "Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are highly aggressive and heterogeneous cancers. There is a clinical need for techniques to image inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity of STS for personalized adaptation of treatment and to improve diagnostic accuracy. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) quantitatively maps spatial variations of functional and structural features of tumors in vivo. mpMRI data was acquired from mice bearing subcutaneous ICR-LMS-1, SK-UT-1 (both leiomyosarcoma, LMS) or HS-SY-II (synovial sarcoma, SS) xenografts. Biomarkers included quantification of the tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), native T1 and T2 relaxation times, magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR), the transverse relaxation rate R2*, and the complex shear modulus |G*| using MR elastography to assess tumor stiffness. Pathology correlates were sought from MRI-aligned histological sections. Frequency histograms visualized the distribution of values to assess statistical dispersion.

Significantly higher MTR in the HS-SY-II tumors suggests greater macromolecule (e.g protein) content. Tumor R2*, a proxy for blood vessels, was slowest in the SK-UT-1 cohort, consistent with their low CD31 positivity. All three models exhibited a relatively soft biomechanical phenotype. HS-SY-II tumors displayed unimodal histograms, suggesting homogeneously distributed MRI biomarkers, and had little inter-tumor variation. In contrast, both LMS models exhibited bi- or trimodal distributions and higher interquartile range values, particularly for ADC, indicating pronounced intratumor heterogeneity and marked inter-tumour variation. mpMRI can inform on and assess differences in tissue heterogeneity within STS subtypes. Quantification of tumor ADC may provide a sensitive MRI biomarker to assess differential response of LMS and SS to therapy, which has clear translational potential.Citation Format:Ellen O'Sullivan, Cl\u00e9mentine Lesbats, Paul H.

    "abstract": "Elimination of senescent cells has been reported to improve normal and pathological changes associated with aging and cancer in mice. However, most senolytic agents inhibit anti-apoptotic pathways that do not differentiate between hyper-inflamed senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) cells from relatively non-inflamed, valuable functional senescent cells, leading to off-target effects in normal tissues. Conditionally Active Biologics (CAB) technology is a proprietary platform unique in its ability to be selectively active in the context of diseased, acidic tissues (e.g. inflamed tissue and tumor microenvironment), but not in alkaline normal tissues. The aberrant accumulation of senescent cells in aged and cancerous tissue triggers increasing inflammatory signaling through SASP, promoting aging and tumor progression. Since these cells have an acidic surface environment, similar to cancer cells, we explored whether CAB technology allows selective removal of senescent cells in SASP-associated microenvironments. In addition, to complement this selectivity, we identified more specific senolytic targets to further reduce side effects and increase the efficiency of senescence cell removal and SASP reduction. In this study we identified several novel senescence-specific surface antigens as senolytic targets both in vitro and in vivo. For the in vivo studies, we developed several fibrosis models in mice, including unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in kidneys, bleomycin- or silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in lung, high-fat diet (HFD)+CCl4-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in liver, and isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis. We confirmed that the novel senescence-specific antigens we identified in our in vitro system are highly expressed in fibrotic tissues with newly induced senescent cells and associated with inflammation in in vivo models. Furthermore, these antigens were co-expressed with senescence makers SA-\u03b2-Gal, GL13, p16 and p21. Finally, we developed duocarmycin-based CAB-antibody drug conjugates (CAB-ADC) to study whether CAB-ADC reduces senescent cell occurrence in vivo. Mice treated with CAB-ADC targeting novel senescence-specific antigens showed a significant reduction of inflammatory cells infiltrated in kidneys compared to mice treated with benchmark and isotype ADCs. Thus, the CAB antibody-based therapeutic is a promising strategy for senescent cell removal in an inflammatory microenvironment using these newly identified senescence-associated targets. In conclusion, CAB technology provides a new generation of biologics with an increased safety margin and therapeutic index, selectively targeting acidic senescence cells and SASP in cancer and age-related diseases.Citation Format:Jian Chen, Jing Wang, Haizheng Liu, Gerhard Frey, Cathy Chang, William J.

    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy characterized by rapid onset of chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes. Following decades of, at best, modest clinical advances, the recent FDA approval of tarlatamab, a DLL3 targeting bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE), alongside unprecedented response rates observed with multiple antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), have ushered in a paradigm shift towards surface targeting strategies in relapsed SCLC patients. These same agents are demonstrating similar efficacy in more rare high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas, both pulmonary and extrapulmonary; however, they are being largely tested in unselected populations. While providing much-needed optimism for SCLC patients, resistance, both de novo and acquired, is common and must be better characterized to maximize the potential of these new therapeutic classes. We hypothesize that combinatorial targeting of multiple surface proteins using distinct strategies (i.e., BiTEs, ADCs, etc.) represents a novel way to overcome intratumoral heterogeneity common to relapsed SCLC and enhance antitumor immunity engendered by ADC payloads (i.e., topoisomerase 1 [TOP1] inhibitor). To better define the surfaceome of relapsed SCLC, we performed surfaceome mass spectrometry analysis of SCLC cell lines, na\u00efve and relapsed patient derived xenografts (PDXs), and PDXs treated with frontline chemotherapy until relapse occurred, and identified a number of novel and known surface proteins (i.e., TROP2, HER2, B7H3). Surface targeting strategies against HER2, TROP2, and DLL3 are effective in preclinical models (i.e., cell lines and xenograft models) resistant to other common SCLC therapies (i.e., platinum chemotherapy). In particular, ADCs with TOP1 inhibitor payloads were more effective in models with high SLFN11 and target levels, suggesting that sensitivity requires both surface target expression and SLFN11 positivity for greatest response. Notably, single-cell transcriptional profiling of relapsed patient biopsies revealed mutually exclusive expression of surface genes in distinct cell populations, including senescent, drug tolerant persister cells (DTPCs), representing an unique opportunity to target heterogeneous populations. We show that combination targeting against different surface proteins (e.g., DLL3, TROP2, HER2) using both immune (i.e., chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, BiTEs) and payload-based modalities (i.e., ADCs) was more effective than single-agent targeting in resistant, neuroendocrine-low models. Therefore, intratumoral heterogeneity associated with relapsed SCLC, which limits efficacy of single-agent surface targeting strategies, may be exploited with combinatorial therapies to target resistant cell populations, including DTPCs, using payload and immune-based methods.Citation Format:C.

    "abstract": "Background:EGFR and HER3, both belong to the EGFR family, are widely overexpressed in human malignancies, rendering them promising targets for cancer treatment. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Inter- and intratumor heterogeneity is believed to be a major factor contributing to recurrence, metastasis and resistance to current socs. To address these therapeutic challenges, we generated JSKN021, a dual payload ADC targeting EGFR/HER3. Both payloads, a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor (T01, Alphatecan) and MMAE, are conjugated to glycan on Fc via cleavable linkers. The conjugation processes were carried out via combination of glycan transferase and click reaction. The streamlined process generated site specific and homogeneous conjugation with DAR4(T01)and DAR2 (MMAE).In this study, the pharmacological activity of JSKN021 was evaluated using relevant in vitro cell killing assays and in vivo models.Methods:A novel Topo 1 inhibitor T01 and MMAE were stably conjugated to an EGFR/HER3 mAb using a glycan based site-specific manner. The conjugated products were characterized by LC-MS. Binding specificity of JSKN021 was confirmed by ELISA. In addition, release of payload were evaluated by LC-HRMS. At last, in vitro cell growth inhibitory and in vivo antitumor activities of JSKN021 were evaluated using different cancer cell lines and CDX models in comparison to single payload ADCs.Results:After conjugation, LC-MS results showed that JSKN021 had a homogeneous DAR4 for T01 payload and DAR2 for MMAE. JSKN021 was demonstrated to bind EGFR and HER3 simultaneously. In addition, both T01 and MMAE were detected in cell culture supernatant and suspension of HCC827. Yet, no other metabolites were found detectable. JSKN021 demonstrated excellent stability in rats, mice, monkeys, and human serum, with minimal payload release. The stability was derived from the advantage of glycan based conjugation. JSKN021 inhibited the growth of cancer cells with either Her3 or EGFR or both expression, such as HCC827, MDA-MB-468, A431 and NCI-H1975. Furthermore, JSKN021 showed stronger tumor inhibition efficacy than mono payload ADCs in multiple CDX models.Conclusion:The preclinical studies suggest JSKN021, as a dual-payload EGFR/HER3 bispecific ADC, might be a promising novel antitumor therapeutic agent.Citation Format:Ting Xu, Fan Li, Zhilong Lai, Rupeng Qu.

    "abstract": "Introduction:B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) overexpression has been found on the surface of the malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow of multiple myeloma (MM) patients. In recent years, innovative medicines targeting BCMA such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), T-cell engager and CAR-T have made great progress in the treatment of MM patients. Among them, belantamab mafodotin has been approved by FDA. However, a significant fraction of patients does not respond, or respond for a short period of time, to belantamab mafodotin. Thus, there remains unmet medical needs for BCMA-targeting ADC with novel mode of actions. DB-1325 is a novel BCMA-targeting ADC comprised of belantamab and PDUP5, a Duality Unique Payload (DUP) inhibiting mRNA translation, conjugated through a cleavable linker.Methods:A proprietary inhibitor of mRNA translation PDUP5 was discovery through a campaign of medicinal chemical design and screening. A cleavable linker was designed to be attached to PDUP5, resulting in LPDUP5. Belantamab was conjugated with LPDUP5 to yield DB-1325. The therapeutic profile of DB-1325, including in vitro and in vivo efficacy, and its safety profile was assessed in preclinical models.Results:PDUP5 exhibited sub-nanomolar to nanomolar potency in in vitro cell killing test on various MM cell lines. DB-1325 (belantamab-LPDUP5) showed robust in vitro anti-proliferation activity in multiple BCMA-expressing cell models (e.g. NCI-H929, KMS-11, MM1S, MOLP8) with activity similar to belantamab mafodotin. In addition, we observed robust efficacy of DB-1325 in several in vivo xenograft models following a single dose treatment. In NCI-H929 CDX model, treatment with DB1325 demonstrated anti-tumor activity superior to belantamab mafodotin when given at an equivalent dose. Furthermore, DB-1325 was well-tolerated at a preliminary toxicology assessment using monkeys, with favorable toxicokinetic profile.Conclusions:DB-1325 is a novel and promising therapy for MM and currently in preclinical development as a first-in-class ADC with mRNA translation inhibitions as its major mode of action.Citation Format:Shengchao Lin, Bing Li, Yu Zhang, Jun Yao, Rong Shi, Yang Qiu, Haiqing Hua.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer with poor 5-year survival. Interventions during the premalignant stage of carcinogenesis can improve outcomes. Epithelial progenitors are critical cells that maintain and repair the epithelium due to their proliferation and multipotent differentiation. Previously, we discovered diminished function of progenitor cells in the premalignant lung containing ADC. In the current study, we tested whether progenitor dysfunction in premalignancy involves changes in progenitor proliferation and/or differentiation.Methods:Lung tissues resected for early-stage ADC (N=14) were used, and progenitor function was determined using a 3D organoid culture. Lung organoids were grown from the uninvolved (UN, 5-15 cm) and tumor-adjacent lungs (TA, 0.2-2 cm) from the tumor. We hypothesized that processes active in these spatially distinct areas from the tumor-bearing lungs represent oncogenic changes in premalignancy. Organoids were cultured under either proliferation or differentiation conditions, and molecular profiles of organoids were examined by single-cell RNA-sequencing (ScRNA-seq).Results:Analysis of proliferation and differentiation showed an opposing outcome for the UN and TA tissues. Under proliferation conditions, greater numbers of organoids were made by the cells from TA, while under differentiation, UN areas gave rise to higher numbers of organoids (p<0.05 both). Furthermore, proliferative organoids from UN tissues expressed higher numbers of KRT5+/P63+ basal stem cells compared to organoids from TA, while higher numbers of Ki67+ proliferative cells were present in TA organoids (p<0.05 both). In contrast, there was no difference in epithelial cell types present in organoids grown from UN and TA tissues under differentiation conditions. ScRNA-seq comparing transcriptomic profiles of organoids from TA and UN tissues showed that under proliferation, TA organoids contained a specific cluster of basal cells that was enriched for genes belonging to EGFR signaling with higher expression of amphiregulin (AREG), a canonical ligand for EGFR. Immunostaining of organoids from TA and UN tissues confirmed significantly higher numbers of AREG+ cells in TA organoids. The addition of exogenous AREG in proliferative media with or without EGFR inhibitor showed that AREG can drive progenitor cell proliferation independent of EGFR.Conclusions:Our results suggest that progenitor dysfunction in ADC premalignancy involves increased proliferation and decreased differentiation. AREG has been described as a marker of transitional cells involved in cancer development. Thus, our findings indicate that progenitors within the TA tissue express transitional cell phenotype. Future analysis will focus on the AREG-mediated signaling in progenitor cell proliferation during premalignancy.Citation Format:Khosbayar Lkhagvadorj, Bridget K Greuel, Alexis S Assante, Amy B Frey, Simran Randhawa, Adrie VanBokheven, York E Miller, Moumita Ghosh.

    "abstract": "Background:Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer (BC), with risk factors including greater frequency of recurrence and metastasis and lower overall survival rate compared to other BC subtypes. While the drivers of TNBC are unclear, Trop2 is a transmembrane protein that has been found to be highly expressed in TNBC, whose role in tumor progression is not well understood. High expression of Trop2 has led to the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting wild-type Trop2, including Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-dxd). However, Trop2 is an intronless gene but can be posttranslationally cleaved by ADAM10 and other proteases in malignant tissues. Cleavage of Trop2 and its effect on tumor progression and drug resistance have not been previously explored, which is becoming increasingly crucial to understand as more Trop2-targeting therapies enter clinical practice.Experimental Methods and Results: To determine the oncogenic capacity of cleaved Trop2, our lab has generated a construct of N-terminally cleaved Trop2 \u2206Q31-R87 called Trop2-\u2206N and have stably transduced mouse TNBC MM3MG cells, a cell line that is not well transformed and grows poorly in immune competent mice. SCID-beige mice who lack T and B cells and have non-functional NK cells and immune competent BALB/c were injected with wild-type Trop2, an uncleavable form of Trop2 called Trop2-87/88, Trop2-\u2206N, and control to find that Trop2-\u2206N conferred a proliferative phenotype, which was comparable to the known oncogene HER2\u220616. Additionally, MM3MG cells were stained for SG, Dato-dxd, and their parental monoclonal antibodies and analyzed for binding via flow cytometry. We found that SG and Dato-dxd had lowered binding capacity towards Trop2-\u2206N expressing cells. To determine if the killing capacity of these ADCs were altered, we transduced the human breast epithelial cell line MCF10AT with our constructs of uncleavable Trop2-87/88 and Trop2-\u2206N to find that both SG and Dato-dxd to have lowered killing against Trop2-\u2206N expressing cells.Conclusions:Our studies found that N-terminally cleaved Trop2 induces a proliferative phenotype in vivo, reduce binding capacity of Trop2 ADCs, and are more resistance to ADC-induced killing in vitro. These data provide insight into the potential importance of N-terminally cleaved Trop2 in tumor progression and drug resistance that have not been explored. Future experiments will elucidate the mechanisms that underlie cleavage of Trop2 and refining Trop2-targeting therapies.Citation Format:Andrea E.

    "abstract": "The human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2) is a key member of the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily. Alterations in HER2 have been identified in various malignancies, including approximately 20% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and about 30% of breast cancer (BRCA). These HER2 alterations encompass gene mutations, gene amplification, and protein overexpression, all of which are associated with tumorigenesis and contribute to enhanced cancer cell proliferation. Cancers with HER2 alterations often exhibit more aggressive behavior, a higher recurrence rate, and a poorer prognosis. The introduction of HER2-directed therapies has significantly improved therapeutic outcomes. FDA-approved therapeutic options for HER2-positive cancers can be categorized into three major groups: tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). These treatments specifically target the HER2 receptor or its downstream signaling pathways. However, many studies show that nonselective TKIs and HER2 naked antibodies demonstrate limited therapeutic effectiveness in HER2-positive cancers. In contrast, HER2-directed ADCs selectively deliver cytotoxic compounds to HER2-positive tumor cells, resulting in better responses and fewer adverse effects, as evidenced by numerous preclinical and clinical studies. In our current work, to showcase our well-characterized PDX-O platform BRCA and NSCLC models were selected and assessed to be HER2 positive as evidenced by complete and intense membrane staining identified in patient-derived xenograft organoids (PDXOs) tissue blocks. Furthermore, from early low passages, assay-ready cells were seeded in a 96-well plate high throughput format at a density of 5000 cells per well. Well-defined 3D structures formed after 3 days, and the models were evaluated for morphology and proliferation assessment. Cytotoxicity controls: 10 \u00b5M Staurosporine and 0.1% DMSO were added to each plate to serve as plate controls and used in determining the Z factor of the assay. The models were tested for efficacy of Lapatinib (TKI); and Enhertu and Kadcyla (ADC) and their corresponding Isotypes. All models demonstrated a classic 3D morphology with > 150 \u00b5m diameter formed 72 hrs. after seeding; and were then dosed. The duration of drug incubation was 6 days after which Cell-Titer-Glo\u00ae reagent was added to all wells to determine half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The assay was robust with a Z factor > 0 and a high Signal: Noise ratio. Specifically for one model, the IC50 of Lapatinib was 69.15 \u00b5M. Both ADCs: Kadcyla and Enhertu, exhibited greater specificity and efficacy compared to their isotype controls. The ex vivo HER2-positive CTG3D platform represents a reliable and powerful tool for screening newly designed HER2 treatment regimens.Citation Format:Fu-Ju Chou, Yamini Nallana, Hsiu-Wen Tsai, Mara Gilardi, Stefano Cairo, BanuPriya Sridharan.

    "abstract": "Introduction:B7-H3, an attractive target for antibody drug conjugate, is overexpressed in multiple tumors. Overexpression of B7-H3 in tumor cells frequently correlates with fewer tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, faster cancer progression, and poor clinical outcome in several malignancies. Preliminary evidence revealed PARP inhibitors (PARPi) and B7-H3-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) as two practical approaches to overcome chemoresistance in solid cancers. Thus, synthetic lethality exploitation by an anti-B7-H3 ADC plus PARPi might be a promising strategy in solid tumor models. Here, we investigated the activity of 7MW3711, a B7-H3-directed ADC bearing a novel isomerase I inhibitor (TOP1i) payload, alone and in combination with PARPi, in preclinical models to evaluate the potential for future clinical application.Method:7MW3711 was evaluated in vitro and vivo efficacy with or without PARPi (Olaparib or AZD5305). In vitro, human cancer cell lines were treated with 7MW3711 and two PARPi to determine the effect on anti-proliferative effects, double-stranded DNA breaks, and cell-cycle arrest. In vivo, mice bearing ovarian and SCLC tumor xenografts were treated with the combination of 7MW3711 and PARPi.Results:Evaluation of the drug resistance ability in cell lines expressing P-gp revealed 7MW3711 exhibited > 3-fold more potent than DS7300 (B7-H3-directed DXd ADC), indicating that 7MW3711 has a lower efflux efficiency in drug-resistant strains. 7MW3711 combined use of PARPi synergistically potentiated the inhibitory effects of 7MW3711 on the growth of B7-H3-positive cancer cells, inducing DNA damage and apoptosis. The highest level of double-stranded DNA breaks was observed in cells treated with combination which can be determined in the upregulation of \u03b3-H2AX protein. Combination increased both G2/M phase-arrested cells and S-phase cells, reduced G1-phase, indicating that most proliferating cells were arrested. Combining 7MW3711 with olaparib or AZD5305 produced significant antitumor effects and survival benefit above that achieved with monotherapy in various B7-H3-positive solid tumor xenografts. Collectively, our results demonstrate the synergistic antitumor activity of combining 7MW3711 with PARPi, suggesting that DNA damage-repair inhibitors in combination with B7-H3-targeted ADCs is a promising approach for treating B7-H3-positive malignancies.Conclusion:These data provide evidence for the potential utility of 7MW3711 combination with PARPi for treatment of B7-H3-expressing tumors and support the rationale for further clinical studies.Citation Format:Xiaowei Cen, Peng Fang, Yueyue Yang, Dongan Yu, Yueqin Yao, Fei Mei, Xueying Li, Meng You, Yiyan Zhang, Long Yin, Xiaowei Sun, Xiaoding Tan, Wei Zhou, Hai Wu.

    "abstract": "Background:Bispecific antibody-drug conjugates (BiADCs) are innovative anticancer therapeutics that simultaneously bind to two targets. The limitations of single-target antibody-drug conjugates(ADCs) have become evident due to tumor heterogeneity. BiADCs are expected to overcome the limitations of single-target ADCs by broadening the targetable regions within the tumor. Here, we have developed a platform based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data to identify the optimal pair of targets that maximizes the therapeutic efficacy and minimizes the systemic toxicity of BiADCs.Methods:We created an integrated cell atlas by combining the human single-cell transcriptomics atlas from \u2018Tabula Sapiens\u2019 and the cancer scRNA-seq datasets from the \u2018Curated Cancer Cell Atlas\u2019. to calculate the \u2018Organ-Level Specificity\u2019 (expression fold-change between cancer and matched normal tissue) and the \u2018Critical Organ Toxicity\u2019 (average target expression in critical organs). And the ST data are used to calculate the \u2018Intratumoral target expression\u2019, \u2018Microenvironment-Level Target Specificity\u2019, defined by the expression of the target in malignant cells relative to normal cells. We utilized Visium data from 96 breast cancer based on the tissue microarray. These checkpoints were calculated for BiADCs by simultaneously analyzing two selected targets and computed for all possible target pairs. We focused on 13 targets that are actively being investigated in clinical trials for ADCs in solid tumors.Results:After calculating the checkpoints for each target pair, we identified target pairs that are expected to perform better than single targets based on the following criteria. First, we selected pairs that showed higher checkpoint values compared to their corresponding single targets. Then, from these selected pairs, we chose those that outperformed their corresponding single targets in at least three checkpoints. Applying the criteria, we identified target pairs for BiADCs that are likely to achieve superior therapeutic outcomes compared to single targets. The pairs involving CEACAM5 or VTCN1 generally achieve a high therapeutic index. And the target pairs with VTCN1 exhibit lower critical organ toxicity compared to other targets for breast cancer.Conclusion:The platform presented in this study utilizes scRNAseq and ST data to systematize the complex target selection process for BiADCs. We developed checkpoints to evaluate target efficacy at the systemic level using scRNAseq and at the tumor microenvironment level using ST data. Using breast cancer as an example case and the list of 13 ADC targets, we identified CEACAM5 or VTCN1-based target pairs as optimal partners for BiADCs. Consequently, our pipeline demonstrated its ability to identify target pairs that are expected to perform better than specific single-target ADCs.Citation Format:Minki Choi, Sungwoo Bae, Dongjoo Lee, Hongyoon Choi.

    "abstract": "Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer (PC), gastric cancer (GC), and colorectal cancer (CRC), where high expression levels of TROP2 correlate with poor prognosis. OBI-902 is a novel site-specific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of a humanized anti-TROP2 monoclonal antibody linked to a topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor payload with drug-to-antibody ratio of 4 via OBI\u2019s proprietary glycan conjugation platform (GlycOBI\u00ae) and dual-action enzymatic technology (EndoSymeOBI\u00ae). This unique linker-payload design is expected to enhance the ADC stability and improve the efficiency of payload delivery in tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of OBI-902 in challenging solid tumors. In vitro linker-payload stability was evaluated in human serum albumin via LC-MS. Pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed in the serum and tumor of NSCLC xenograft mouse model. The antitumor activity studies of OBI-902 were conducted in NSCLC, PC, GC, and challenging CRC xenograft mouse models with Dato-DXd, SG, or MK-2870 as benchmarks. The antitumor activities were evaluated in both tumor volumes of 200-250 mm3 and 500-550 mm3 (large tumor burden). Survival was analyzed with the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test with *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Humane endpoint: Tumor volume was larger than 1500 mm3. OBI-902 showed superior in vitro linker-payload stability than the Dato-DXd. In addition, OBI-902 exhibited favorable PK profiles with excellent ADC stability in circulation and efficient payload release in NSCLC xenograft model. The tumor-to-serum ratios of payload Cmax and AUC0-t were 33 and 86, respectively. OBI-902 achieved 4.2-fold higher intra-tumor payload exposure than that of MK-2870 at the same dosage. OBI-902 exhibited potent and durable antitumor activities. In the GC xenograft model, tumor volume reductions of OBI-902 were 3.6- to 6.2-fold better compared to benchmarks, by day 57. In the challenging CRC model, OBI-902 showed a sustained suppression of tumor growth by day 56 (329 \u00b1 110 mm3) compared to benchmark ADCs which reached over 1000 mm3 before day 18. In the large-tumor NSCLC xenograft model, OBI-902 achieved superior antitumor activity, with 40% of treated mice surviving beyond day 70. In contrast, all mice treated with benchmarks were sacrificed early (tumor volume >1500 mm) at days between 29 and 42. Similarly, in the large-tumor PC xenograft model, OBI-902 prolonged survival beyond day 50, while all mice in the benchmark groups were sacrificed by day 28. OBI-902 can efficiently deliver payload to the site of action (tumor) to achieve desirable drug exposure and sustainable antitumor activities in various challenging solid tumors, pointing to its potential to be the best-in-class TROP2 ADC.Citation Format:Ren-Yu Hsu, Chi-Huan Lu, Chi-Sheng Shia, Hsin-Shan Wu, Lu-Tzu Chen, Jhih-Jie Yang, Jyy-Shiuan Tu, Hui-Wen Chang, Shih-Ni Wen, Ming-Tain Lai, Ya-Chi Chen.

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the United States. Many women (>80%) with OC are diagnosed at an advanced stage and a 5-year survival rate of less than 30%. Newer therapies, such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), have revolutionized the treatment landscape for solid tumors, including ovarian cancer. While platinum-based chemotherapy stays the stalwart in systemic therapy for OC treatment, most of these patients experience recurrence (>50%) despite receiving standard of care therapy. Hence, significant efforts are made to target candidates for a personalized approach to therapy. 9 eligible patients with biopsy confirmed, newly diagnosed, advanced-stage serous EOC deemed appropriate for NACT seen at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Gynecologic Oncology clinic were recruited. EMR was reviewed and demographic, survival, surgery, and tumor response data were collected. Target receptor expression pre and post ADC treatment was also evaluated using IHC staining of the target protein. Actively, we are using spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to assess DNA damage and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) pre and post NACT. Repair assisted damage detection (RADD) assay, The Lunaphore COMET and Nanostring GeoMx platform will all be utilized to perform this analysis. The RADD assay gives a DNA damage score that will be compared pre- and post-treatment. The Lunaphore COMET antibody staining panel will include antibodies against the surface and intracellular proteins pan-cytokeratin, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD20, CD25, CD31, CD68, DAPI, Granz B, FOXP3, CXCR3, CXCR5, CCR6, CTLA4, PD-1, PDL1, TIM3, and pan-cytokeratin, allowing us to evaluate changes in subpopulations within the tumor immune microenvironment in response to ADCs in combination with platinum therapy. NanoString GeoMX platform will use targeted transcriptomic sequencing to further evaluate PanCK+ tumor cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD8+ T cells, or subpopulations identified from COMET results. Results Median age of this cohort was 68.5 (52-81), most patients were white (n=7), all patients had stage III or IV disease (n=9). Based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, median change in tumor burden from baseline was -19.31% (+9.81% to -85.64%), showing the impact of NACT. The secondary outcomes of this study are to identify predictive biomarkers as potential therapeutic targets through analysis proteomics and transcriptomics. ADCs have demonstrated potential to monitor change in tumor burden, thereby validating the efficacy of targeted therapy based on protein or receptor expression in OC. Utilizing technologies such as COMET and Nano-string, our results will help us understand the intricacies of NACT therapy in the context of ADCs and contribute to pave the way for a more tailored therapeutic approach.Citation Format:Dhruva Dave, Natalie R.

    "abstract": "Objective:Uterine serous carcinoma is a rare biologically aggressive type of endometrial cancer associated with a high rate of mortality. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is a novel ADC composed of the humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, a cleavable tetrapeptide linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. TROP2 expression is detected in up to 95% of uterine serous carcinoma (USC) cases, making it an excellent target for therapy. We evaluated the preclinical activity of Dato-DXd in vitro against primary USC cell lines with various TROP2 expression and in vivo in TROP2 overexpressing cell-line derived xenografts in mice.Methods:Primary USC cell lines were established from chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients at time of surgery and analyzed by flow cytometry for TROP2 expression. USC cell lines with varying TROP2 expression levels were treated with scalar concentrations of Dato-DXd or a non-targeting ADC isotype control (CTL ADC). Flow cytometry-based assays were used to evaluate viability. RepresentativeTROP2 expressing USC were co-cultured with a TROP2 non-expressing USC cell line to evaluate bystander effect. Four-hour chromium release assays were used to evaluate Dato-DXd ability to induce antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro. Finally, mice xenograft models were established from a selected TROP2 3+ cell line (ie, USC-ARK2) to evaluate the in vivo activity of Dato-DXd vs treatment with vehicle, datopotomab (unconjugated antibody), or control (CTL) ADC with an endpoint of overall survival.Results:In vitro, TROP2 overexpressing cell lines demonstrated remarkable sensitivity to Dato-DXd compared to CTL ADC. When high TROP2 USC cells were admixed with TROP2 low-expression cells, significant bystander cytotoxicity was observed (p=0.03). Mechanistically, double stranded DNA breakage was demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of the histone H2AX in TROP2 positive cell lines after DATO-DXd exposure vs CTL ADC. In the TROP2 selected cell lines, both Dato-DXd and datopotomab were effective in inducing significant ADCC when challenged with heterologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (p= \u2264 0.05 ). In vivo, Dato-DXd demonstrated a significant survival advantage in mice xenografted with ARK2 compared to the other treatment groups (p<0.0001). By day 10, ARK-2 xenografted mice treated with Dato-DXd had significantly decreased growth when compared to the other three treatments which experienced continued linear growth. The median survival for Dato-DXd was not reached as all mice were still alive at the conclusion of the study on day 60 (p<0.0001).Conclusions:Dato-DXd demonstrates remarkable preclinical activity both in vitro as well as in vivo against biologically aggressive USC primary cell lines and xenografts. Clinical trials are warranted.Citation Format:Michelle Greenman, Cem Demirkiran, Stefania Bellone, Tobias Hartwich, Blair McNamara, Victoria Ettorre, Niccolo G.

    "abstract": "TROP2 (trophoblast cell surface antigen 2) is expressed at high levels in various human carcinomas and is associated with tumor differentiation and pathological aggression. Several antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting TROP2, such as sacituzumab govitecan and datopotamab deruxtecan, have shown promising anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumors, particularly in breast cancer. However, their clinical application remains limited by inadequate efficacy, highlighting the unmet clinical need for improving the efficacy of single payload TROP2-targeting ADCs.This study presents the preclinical evaluation of a novel dual-payload TROP2-targeting ADC, KH815, composed of a humanized IgG1 antibody (hRS7) directed against TROP2 which is conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor(TOP1i) and an RNA polymerase II inhibitor(RNA POL IIi). KH815 achieves an average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of about 7.5 (4+3.5) using cysteine and glycoside antibody coupling technologies with an appropriate DAR, high SEC purity, homogeneous particle size distribution, and favorable thermal stability.The dual mechanism of KH815 enables the simultaneous inhibition of RNA synthesis and the induction of DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in a potent and synergistic anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo xenograft mouse models in comparison to other TOP1i-TROP2-targeting ADCs. In both cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, KH815 exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity compared to the single-TOP1i ADC, at equivalent or even lower doses. Furthermore, KH815 has been shown to be more effective than TOP1i-ADC (sacituzumab govitecan and datopotamab deruxtecan) in tumor inhibition in a PDX model derived from Trodelvy pretreated patients and in a HCT-15 cell CDX model, which expresses P-gp protein, a pump that can extrude DXd. This provides additional evidence that KH815 has the potential to overcome resistance to TOP1i-ADCs. The non-GLP toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys provided evidence of the favorable safety profile of KH815, the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) is 40 mg/kg/dose.In summary, KH815, an ADC with dual toxins and unique mechanisms of action, displayed superior anti-tumor effects, the ability to overcome drug resistance, and an acceptable safety profile in preclinical studies. These findings support the potential of KH815 as a promising advanced therapeutic candidate for tumors.Citation Format:Yonghao Zhao, Pengfei Ren, Menglong Guan, Jiao Tang, Lu Qi, Xinzou Fan, Shijun Yin, Gang Lei, Xiao Ke.

    "abstract": "Background:Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric sarcoma, representing 3-4% of childhood and adolescent cancers. While multimodal therapies improved the outcomes for localized disease, 5-year survival for relapsed or metastatic RMS cases remains poor. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) use the specificity of monoclonal antibodies to selectively deliver potent anticancer chemotherapy agents to tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues. FGFR4, a cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase highly expressed in RMS and other cancers such as some breast cancers, but minimally in normal tissues, is a promising immune target. We hypothesize that FGFR4-targeted ADCs could effectively treat RMS and other FGFR4-positive cancers with limited systemic toxicity.Methods:High-affinity human FGFR4-specific binders were developed and evaluated for their internalization in RMS cell lines. The top candidate 3A11, a murine monoclonal antibody, was conjugated to either monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a cathepsin cleavable mcValCit-PABC linker (3A11-MMAE), or an Exatecan derivative via a legumain-cleavable mpGlyAsnAsn linker (3A11-Exatecan). ADCs\u2019 in-vitro efficacy was assessed in FGFR4-positive or FGFR4-negative cells using a live-cell analysis system. Western blots were performed to validate their action mechanisms. Finally, ADCs' in-vivo efficacy was tested in 3 subcutaneous xenograft models: fusion-positive RMS (RH4), fusion-negative RMS with an FGFR4 V550L activating mutation (RMS559), and FGFR4-positive breast cancer (MDA-MB-453).Results:3A11 was internalized by FGFR4-positive cells and the internalization efficiency was significantly correlated with FGFR4 surface expression levels. Both ADCs selectively killed FGFR4-expressing cells, with their potency correlating with FGFR4 expression and 3A11 internalization. Western blot confirmed that 3A11-MMAE induced specific apoptosis and 3A11-Exatecan induced cell death after DNA damage in FGFR4-expressing RMS cells. In vivo, 3A11-MMAE (3 mg/kg, twice weekly for two weeks) delayed RH4 tumor growth, improving survival by 30%, whereas a single dose of 3A11-Exatecan (10 mg/kg) eradicated RH4 tumors, achieving 100% survival. In the aggressive RMS559 model, 40% of 3A11-MMAE treated mice achieved tumor clearance, with a 70% survival rate. While two doses of 3A11-Exatecan completely eradicated RMS559 tumors. Furthermore, both ADCs effectively controlled MDA-MB-453 breast cancer growth.Conclusionsand Future Directions: Our results demonstrate an unprecedented efficacy of these FGFR4-targeting ADCs specifically against human cancers expressing FGFR4 including aggressive rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancers. We plan to humanize the 3A11 binder and perform pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies in non-human primates for preparation in clinical trials.Citation Format:Meijie Tian, Katrina Jia, Jerry T.

    "abstract": "Background:EGFR and cMet are widely co-expressed in solid tumors, and there is crosstalk between their signaling pathways, which is the general escape mechanism for each other in clinic. Although various drugs targeting EGFR and/or cMet have been approved or are in clinical development, primary and acquired resistance limits their prolonged efficacy. There still remains a large unmet need in solid tumor therapy. SCR-A006 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprising a bispecific mAb targeting EGFR&cMET conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) via a cleavable and hydrophilic linker, which potentially benefits a broad population of solid tumor patients.Methods:Physiochemical and biological properties of SCR-A006 were evaluated. The binding affinity and cytotoxicity of SCR-A006 were investigated in vitro using cancer cell lines containing different target expression levels, tumor types (lung, head and neck, breast, gastric, colorectal and pancreas), as well as genomic landscapes. In vivo pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in several CDX and PDX models with different EGFR expression levels or mutations. Preclinical PK studies and tissue distributions were performed by intravenous injection of SCR-A006 at 5mg/kg single in WT mice and tumor cell xenograft mice.Results:SCR-A006 exhibited strong cytotoxicity against a broad range of tumor cell lines with higher potency than benchmark ADC, but did not enhance toxicity to normal cells, suggesting a larger therapeutic window. In vivo, SCR-A006 demonstrated dose-dependent tumor inhibition and was more effective than benchmark ADC in xenograft models regardless of tumor types and genetic profiles. SCR-A006 also showed good efficacy and was superior to benchmark ADC in amivantamab resistant xenograft models. Excitingly, we found complete response and prolonged efficacy in NSCLC PDX model. To figure out the mechanism of better efficacy compared to benchmark ADC, PK and cleavage efficiency in tumor or normal tissue from CDX model of SCR-A006 were carried out, which showed better tumor penetration and higher cleavable efficiency in tumor homogenate than benchmark ADC but very limited cleavage in normal tissue. SCR-A006 also displayed higher hydrophilicity and more excellent plasma stability than Benchmark ADC. All of above performance potentially resulted the better efficacy and good safety of SCR-A006.Conclusions:Taken together, these findings highlight the potential of SCR-A006 as a therapeutic candidate for broad treatment of solid tumors and with a larger therapeutic window than other EGFR/cMET BsADCs. IND enabling studies of SCR-A006 are currently underway, and planned to initiate clinical study in 2025.Citation Format:Yayuan Fu, Chaochao Cen, Lei Jiang, Xiaohua Yan, Chuanchuan Lu, Qian Wang, Ye Hong, Renhong Tang.

    "abstract": "Background:T-DXd, a HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), has shown transformative potential in cancer therapy but is implicated in causing fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) in clinical trials. The mechanistic basis for these ADC-induced adverse effects remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether T-DXd-induced ILD represents an off-target adverse event (AE) and to explore the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.Methods:We analyzed HER2 antigen expression in a panel of 98 normal human lung tissues to determine whether T-DXd-induced ILD is on-target or off-target. To study the mechanisms of ILD, we developed an immunocompetent murine model that replicates T-DXd-induced lung toxicity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified alveolar macrophages (AMs) as the primary cell type affected by T-DXd in the lung microenvironment. Intravital microscopy was employed to visualize how perivascular AMs engulf T-DXd via Fc-Fc\u03b3R engagement. To mitigate T-DXd-induced toxicity, a pre-conditioning strategy using IgG1 or the parental antibody of T-DXd was tested in the murine model.Results:Analysis of HER2 expression in normal lung tissues revealed minimal expression, confirming that T-DXd-induced ILD is an off-target AE. Single-cell RNA sequencing and intravital microscopy identified perivascular AMs as the key mediators of lung toxicity, driven by Fc-Fc\u03b3R engagement with T-DXd. This interaction triggered a phenotypic shift in AMs toward an inflammatory, pro-ILD state, characterized by activation of the SPP1 pathway. Pre-conditioning AMs with IgG1 or the parental antibody of T-DXd effectively reduced ADC uptake, alleviating lung inflammation and immune activation in the murine model.Conclusion:T-DXd-induced ILD is an off-target AE mediated by Fc-Fc\u03b3R-driven phagocytosis of T-DXd by perivascular alveolar macrophages. This interaction promotes an inflammatory SPP1high phenotype in AMs, leading to lung inflammation and immune activation. Pre-conditioning strategies targeting AMs offer a potential clinical approach to reduce nonspecific ADC uptake and mitigate lung toxicity. These findings provide significant insights into the mechanisms of ADC-induced toxicities and potential intervention strategies.Citation Format:Qing Wei, Teng Yang, Ziwen Zhang, Jiayu Zhu, Xiru Xue, Jieer Ying, Peng Guo, Xiangdong Cheng.

    "abstract": "We have developed a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), based on the mAb L100, that selectively targets a O-GalNAc-glycoprotein expressed in approximately 20% of all breast cancer. Unlike many ADC programs targeting Breast Cancer, L100 recognizes cancer-specific O-glycosylated versions of proteins do not present on normal tissues circumventing adverse events from on target off tumor binding to healthy tissues. The crystal structure of L100 provides insights into its binding specificity and affinity. L100 exhibits low nanomolar affinity (0.83nM) to the glycoprotein target and has also been developed as a companion diagnostic assay, further validating its potential as a therapeutic target. L100 is conjugated to the microtubule-disrupting agent MMAE and the topoisomerase inhibitor exatecan via a site-specific \u03b2-glucuronidase-cleavable linker. This linker is stable in plasma, but selectively releases the payload in tumor tissues, which exhibits a high expression pattern of beta-glucuronidase. In preclinical studies, the L100 ADC (LCB22A) demonstrated potent and selective cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines (EC50=\u223c4.4 nM) and effectively eliminated tumors in breast cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) with MED = \u223c2mpk. Importantly, L100-MMAE (LCB22A-MMAE) and L100-exatecan (LCB22A-exatecan) were well-tolerated in cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies, with no significant adverse events observed. Additionally, the ADC selectively killed target cells in a human mixed organotypic cancer model without affecting healthy cells, indicating excellent tolerability and safety. By specifically targeting cancer-specific O-glycans expressed only in cancer tissues and employing a tumor-selective payload release mechanism, L100 ADC (LCB22A) offers a promising and safe therapeutic option for treating breast cancer while avoiding the on-target off-tumor toxicity that plague other ADC therapies.Citation Format:Aaron C.

    "abstract": "Background:The MUCIN 1 (MUC1) gene evolved in mammals to protect barrier tissues from biotic and abiotic insults. MUC1 encodes a transmembrane MUC1-C subunit that is activated in response to the loss of homeostasis and promotes proliferative, inflammatory, and remodeling responses necessary for wound repair. However, in contrast to its protective function, prolonged activation of MUC1-C by chronic inflammation drives cancer progression. In cancer cells, MUC1-C forms complexes with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR, at the cell membrane, contributing to downstream RTK\u2192RAS signaling pathways. Previous research identified MUC1-C addiction in KRAS G12D mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, against which there are limited therapeutic options. Treatment of KRAS G12D mutant PDACs has been advanced by development of the MRTX1133 inhibitor; however, resistance to this agent invariably occurs by unclear mechanisms.Results:We report that treatment of PDAC KRAS G12D cells with the MRTX1133 inhibitor is associated with marked induction of cell surface MUC1-C expression. Our results demonstrate that MRTX1133 activates an inflammatory MUC1-C/NF-\u03baB p65 auto-inductive pathway. We further demonstrate that MRTX1133-induced MUC1-C/NF-\u03baB signaling (i) regulates the gasdermin E (GASDME) pore-forming protein that paradoxically protects PDAC cells from pyroptosis, (ii) drives ZEB1 and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and (iii) is necessary for MRTX1133 resistance. These results indicate that MUC1-C is a target for the treatment of MRTX1133 resistant PDAC tumors. There are presently no effective antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for PDAC treatment. In extending our results, we show that an anti-MUC1-C ADC is highly effective against MRTX1133-resistant PDAC KRAS G12D cells and that targeting MUC1-C with the ADC is synergistic with MRTX1133 in vitro. We also demonstrate that the anti-MUC1-C ADC inhibits growth of PDAC MRTX1133 resistant tumor xenografts and PDX models.Conclusions:These findings indicate that MUC1-C confers resistance of PDAC KRAS G12D mutant cells to MRTX1133 and identify MUC1-C as a target for ADC treatment of patients refractory to MRTX1133 treatment.Citation Format:Hiroki Ozawa, Keisuke Shigeta, Shinkichi Takamori, Atrayee Bhattacharya, Donald Kufe.

    "abstract": "HER2-positive breast cancer is characterized by overexpression of the HER2 receptor, driving aggressive tumor growth. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), like trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla, T-DM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu, T-DXd), are effective in targeting HER2-positive tumors, though their efficacy across varying HER2 levels remains under study. This study compares Kadcyla and Enhertu regarding cell proliferation, ADC internalization, and bystander cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines with high (SK-BR-3/SKOV-3), moderate (JIMT-1), and low (MDA-MB-231/MDA-MB-435) HER2 expression. It also examines off-site ADC toxicity in primary non-tumor cells caused by off-target payload delivery.The xCELLigence system, which works via label-free impedance measurements on living cells, was employed to monitor real-time cell proliferation and viability. Both, Kadcyla and Enhertu, eliminate tumor cells, effectively at nanomolar concentrations, correlating with HER2 expression levels. Interestingly, Kadcyla's effect appears at least 24 hours earlier than Enhertu, whereas the unconjugated antibody Trastuzumab itself has little to no effect on tumor cell growth. Low HER2-expressing cells were killed at 1 \u00b5M, the highest dose tested. ADC internalization was analyzed using pH-sensitive, fluorescently labeled Trastuzumab in flow cytometry and microscopy, assessing uptake by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in viable cells. This analysis allowed the comparison of the rate and extent of Trastuzumab uptake across the tested cell lines. A co-culture system evaluated bystander effects, with high HER2-expressing SKOV-3/SK-BR-3 cells co-cultured with luciferase-labeled HER2-negative LN-229 cells. After treatment with Kadcyla or Enhertu, luciferase assays were conducted to assess whether the cytotoxic payload released by the ADCs in HER2-positive cells could affect the viability of neighboring HER2-negative cells. Enhertu demonstrated a bystander effect, whereas Kadcyla, on the other hand, showed a more limited activity, reflecting the non-cleavable linker and the membrane-impermeable nature of its payload DM1.Toxicity analyses of Kadcyla and Enhertu on non-tumor cells, and especially on bone marrow, complement on-target investigations by revealing critical results about their safety profiles. While these ADCs are designed to selectively target tumor cells, off-site toxicity can affect healthy tissues and impair immune system function. Studies on hematopoietic stem cells are essential to assess potential adverse effects on hematopoietic regeneration and differentiation, aiming to reduce unintended immunosuppression. These findings support the optimization of ADC design, to enhance both selectivity and therapeutic windows.Citation Format:Veronica Bergo, Philipp Metzger, Valerie Oberhardt, Jan Eric Ehlert, Holger Weber.

    "abstract": "Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily and involved in intercellular adhesion during inflammatory injury, viral infection, and tumorigenesis. The overexpression of CD54 is associated with the aggressiveness of liver cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, melanoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Moreover, CD54\u2019s role in immune cell adhesion implies that targeting this molecule could potentially enhance the immune response against cancer cells. The identification of CD54 as a candidate gene in prostate tumors exposed to chronic cisplatin administration highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer, including liver cancer. These properties make CD54 a promising target for the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and other targeted therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other malignancies. Through preliminary screening, several monoclonal mouse-derived antibodies with a strong affinity for CD54 were identified. To prevent the human body from developing a human anti-mouse antibody response (HAMA), these antibodies were subjected to a process of mutation and back-mutation to humanization. This meticulous engineering resulted in humanized antibodies with affinities comparable to their murine counterparts, with a dissociation constant (KD) in the pM range. Endocytosis experiments demonstrated that these humanized antibodies effectively internalized within tumor cells, a crucial property for the efficacy of antibody-based therapies. These antibodies were then conjugated with both tubulysin based and CPT-payloads to create series of ADCs. In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that many of the ADCs exhibit potent cytotoxicity against a range of cancer cell lines, including non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, and bile duct cancer. In vivo studies using cell-derived xenograft (CDX) models demonstrated that a single, low-dose administration of a CD54-ADC candidate, DXC020, can significantly inhibit tumor growth and even induce tumor regression in cases such as non-small cell lung cancer. These promising results indicated that CD54-ADCs could become a viable candidate for targeted therapy against tumors expressing CD54, offering a new frontier in the treatment of various cancers, in particular for hepatocellular or hepatobiliary carcinoma, which still remains a global health challenge. The successful humanization of the antibodies, their effective internalization in tumor cells, and the robust cytotoxicity of the resulting DXC020 both in vitro and in vivo models, position the CD54-ADC as a promising candidate in further clinical study.Citation Format:Xingyan Jiang, Tianyu Zhou, Junxiang Jia, Huihui Guo, Yuanyuan Huang, Hangbo Ye, Lingli Zhang, Jun Zheng, Lu Bai, Wenjun Li, Binbin Chen, Qingliang Yang, Robert Zhao.

    "abstract": "The ThiOBI\u00ae platform represents a cutting-edge approach for the development of next-generation cysteine (Cys)-based drug conjugates including a wide range of cysteine-containing biomolecules, such as nanobodies, antibody fragments, and peptides. This platform leverages a novel hydrophilic stable linker that efficiently delivers the drug to the site of action to enhance therapeutic potential. In addition, an irreversible thiol conjugation enables Cys-selective biomolecular modification providing meticulous control of the drug conjugation process.Maleimide is a chemical group commonly used in the design of linkers for bio-conjugation, particularly in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), where it plays a key role in attaching a cytotoxic payload to the antibody through a linker. Seven FDA approved ADCs used Cys-maleimide chemistry. However, a major limitation of the traditional cysteine-maleimide conjugated ADCs is their instability due to retro-Michael deconjugation, which can lead to premature payload release in circulation. The ThiOBI\u00ae platform addresses this challenge by employing a stable hydrophilic linker to prevent such reaction ensuring drug delivery in a more controllable manner. This innovation profoundly improves stability and physicochemical properties of the conjugated biomolecules, minimizes off-target effects, and enhances the overall therapeutic index.In preclinical studies, ThiOBI\u00ae-based ADCs demonstrated potent and durable antitumor activities across a variety of animal models. Notably, the platform possesses substantial flexibility that is capable of incorporating a range of payloads and biomolecular formats, including antibody fragments, nanobodies, and peptides, all of which show enhanced therapeutic activity. This versatility allows for targeting a broader spectrum of cancers and diseases that are not easily addressed by conventional antibody-based ADCs.The promising preclinical results highlight the versatility and therapeutic promise of the ThiOBI\u00ae platform, positioning it as a powerful tool for the development of next-generation drug conjugates. The successful demonstration of potent and durable antitumor activities in animals provides a strong foundation for future clinical development of the biomolecules derived from ThiOBI\u00ae.Citation Format:Yu-Chao Huang, Ting-Wei Liu, Chi-Huan Lu, Ren-Yu Hsu, Nan-Hsuan Wang, Ya-Chi Chen, Ming-Tain Lai, Teng-Yi Huang.

    "abstract": "TROP2 (trophoblast cell surface antigen 2) is expressed at high levels in various human carcinomas and is associated with tumor differentiation and pathological aggression. Several antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting TROP2, such as sacituzumab govitecan and datopotamab deruxtecan, have shown promising anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumors, particularly in breast cancer. However, their clinical application remains limited by inadequate efficacy, highlighting the unmet clinical need for improving the efficacy of single payload TROP2-targeting ADCs.This study presents the preclinical evaluation of a novel dual-payload TROP2-targeting ADC, KH815, composed of a humanized IgG1 antibody (hRS7) directed against TROP2 which is conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor(TOP1i) and an RNA polymerase II inhibitor(RNA POL IIi). KH815 achieves an average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of about 7.5 (4+3.5) using cysteine and glycoside antibody coupling technologies with an appropriate DAR, high SEC purity, homogeneous particle size distribution, and favorable thermal stability.The dual mechanism of KH815 enables the simultaneous inhibition of RNA synthesis and the induction of DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in a potent and synergistic anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo xenograft mouse models in comparison to other TOP1i-TROP2-targeting ADCs. In both cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, KH815 exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity compared to the single-TOP1i ADC, at equivalent or even lower doses. Furthermore, KH815 has been shown to be more effective than TOP1i-ADC (sacituzumab govitecan and datopotamab deruxtecan) in tumor inhibition in a PDX model derived from Trodelvy pretreated patients and in a HCT-15 cell CDX model, which expresses P-gp protein, a pump that can extrude DXd. This provides additional evidence that KH815 has the potential to overcome resistance to TOP1i-ADCs. The non-GLP toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys provided evidence of the favorable safety profile of KH815, the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) is 40 mg/kg/dose.In summary, KH815, an ADC with dual toxins and unique mechanisms of action, displayed superior anti-tumor effects, the ability to overcome drug resistance, and an acceptable safety profile in preclinical studies. These findings support the potential of KH815 as a promising advanced therapeutic candidate for tumors.Citation Format:Yonghao Zhao, Pengfei Ren, Menglong Guan, Jiao Tang, Lu Qi, Xinzou Fan, Shijun Yin, Gang Lei, Xiao Ke.

    "abstract": "Background:Patients affected by Ph-like B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have a high mortality rate and elevated levels of disease relapse upon chemotherapy treatment. More than 60% of Ph-like B-ALL is characterized by genomic rearrangements resulting in high expression levels of the CRLF2/TLSPR receptor on the cell surface. While significant advances have been made in developing targeted agents for B-ALL treatment, the CRLF2-rearranged subpopulation is lacking selective and effective therapies. Here, we report the development and preclinical validation of AM E3-SG3249, a first-in-class \u03b1-CRLF2 Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like B-ALL.Materials and Methods:AM E3, a fully human \u03b1-CRLF2 monoclonal antibody with single-digit nanomolar affinity for the target (5.9 \u00b1 1.0 nM), was identified leveraging our proprietary phage display platform. Due to its rapid internalization rate by CRLF2-expressing cells, AM E3 emerged as an ideal candidate for the development of an ADC targeting CRLF2. Upon conjugation with the cytotoxic payload tesirine (SG3249), a clinically-validated cross-linking agent, AM E3-SG3249 demonstrated a potent anti-tumor effect on both CRLF2-rearranged in vitro cell lines and in vivo orthotopic xenograft models. We also developed an ADC surrogate against murine CRLF2, which has low homology with the human counterpart (<35%), to further prove tolerability of the ADC therapy in preclinical mouse models.Results:AM E3-SG3249 was potently cytotoxic (EC50 = 40pM) against a panel of hCRLF2-rearranged B-ALL cell lines in vitro. Upon single injection in xenograft models, AM E3-SG3249 showed strong anti-tumor activity proportional to receptor density. Moreover, AM E3-SG3249 treatment extended survival of hCRLF2-rearranged B-ALL orthotopic xenografts over standard induction therapy combining vincristine, dexamethasone, and L-asparaginase (VXL). The ADC surrogate mB4 AM23-SG3249 was also efficacious and well-tolerated in xenograft models engineered to overexpress murine CRLF2.Conclusions:AM E3 is a novel monoclonal antibody with ideal features for the development of a first-in-class \u03b1-CRLF2 ADC therapy. AM E3 conjugated with the cytotoxic agent tesirine (SG3249) demonstrated remarkable anti-tumor efficacy and a reasonable therapeutic window for the treatment of CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like B-ALL.Citation Format:Claudia Dall'Armi, Valentina Di Biasio, Chantal Paolini, Daniela Natale, Francesco Scalabr\u00ec, Antonino Missineo, Nadine Alaimo, Maurizio Nuzzo, Anna Demartis, Pamela Di Pasquale, Roberto Benoni, Fulvia Caretti, Elisa Beghetto, Fabrizio Colaceci, Romina Sasso, Vincenzo Pucci, Carlo Toniatti, Alessandro Carugo.

    "abstract": "Folate Receptor \u03b1(FR\u03b1)exhibits an increased expression on cell surfaces in multiple solid tumors, including ovarian, lung, endometrial cancer, with limited expression in normal tissues. Recently, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) with a microtubule inhibitor (MTI) payload, was approved by FDA for FR\u03b1-expressing platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. However, it can cause severe ocular toxicities and show therapeutic efficacies only in patients with high expression. In order to address the unmet needs of additional patient populations, we sought to develop a next generation FR\u03b1-targeting ADC, SYS6041, actively targeting tumors with a broad range of FR\u03b1 expression, especially moderate or low expression levels. SYS6041 was developed adopting a novel ADC platform with a camptothecin-based topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload, Exatecan, tethered to a cleavable linker. The drug-to-antibody ratio standed 8.0. Upon binding to FR\u03b1, SYS6041 underwent receptor-mediated internalization. Subsequent proteolytic cleavage released the cytotoxic payload Exatecan, leading to DNA strand breaks and consequently disrupting DNA replication and transcription. SYS6041 demonstrated potent cytotoxicities against FR\u03b1 expressing cancer cell-lines and effective bystander activities towards tumor cells without FR\u03b1 expression. It demonstrated superior antitumor effects across ovarian endometrial and lung cancer CDX models compared to the MTI-ADC especially in models with low or moderate FR\u03b1 expression, with a minimum effect dose(MED) at 0.75 mg/kg. In a FR\u03b1 moderate ovarian PDX model with Olaparib resistance, SYS6041 significantly inhibited tumor growth at 3 mg/kg, whereas the MTI-ADC showed no inhibitory effect at 6 mg/kg. Furthermore, Exatecan demonstrated a significant enrichment in the tumors of mice bearing tumors, achieving a tumor-to-blood ratio of 182 following a dosage of 6 mg/kg of SYS6041.SYS6041 exhibited a stable PK profile with AUC of Exatecan less than 0.01% of that of total Exatecan in ADC. In a GLP toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey, SYS6041 demonstrated an encouraging tolerability with an HNSTD of 50 mg/kg, and favorable PK and DAR stability, and presented a good tolerability profile with therapeutic window (TW)>66 (HNSTD/MED). In conclusion, the distinct mode of action along with the proprietary drug-linker platform resulted in an excellent in-vivo antitumor potency and safety, which supports the potential of SYS6041 as a novel therapeutic agent that may help address unmet needs in patients with moderate and low FR\u03b1 expressing malignancies.Citation Format:Jieru Liu, Huan Li, Mo Dan, Xiwu Hui, Bin Yao, Yang Zhang, Linlin Xiao, Bin Kang, Can Yuan, Bin Bao, Miaomiao Wei, Chunqing Qu, Yanling Li, Wei Yang.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and radioligand therapies (RLT) have emerged as promising treatment modalities for various cancers. In recent years, there have been numerous approvals of ADCs and RLTs by regulatory agencies, highlighting their clinical success. Despite their success, they still suffer from a common challenge: tumor heterogeneity. Tumor heterogeneity limits not only the patient response, but also the eligible patient population for these therapies. To address this challenge, we have developed a high throughput screening platform to identify small molecule \u201cpriming\u201d agents that selectively upregulate tumor antigens in cancer, but not in normal cells. We have demonstrated that by increasing expression of target antigens on cancer cells, priming agents sensitize tumors to ADCs and can thus improve their efficacy and therapeutic window. Our priming screens thus far included evaluating priming agents for HER3, B7-H4, FR-A, TROP2, HER2, NECTIN-4, and CD123. Additionally, DLL3, c-MET, and SSTR2 are scheduled for early next year.Our lead program focuses on HER3, where we have utilized our library to identify priming agents that upregulate HER3 cell surface expression by 2-3 fold across breast and ovarian cancer cell lines, demonstrating potential for indication-agnostic applications. Mechanistic validation has been achieved through the use of multiple inhibitors within the same pathway, which exhibit similar priming effects. Notably, HER3 upregulation is cancer-selective, with expression levels remaining low in normal cells. Ongoing experiments aim to further elucidate the underlying mechanism, and we have initiated medicinal chemistry efforts to advance this program.Utilizing a priming approach in conjunction with an ADC or radiopharmaceutical offers three distinct advantages that lead to best-in-class or first-in-class therapies:Patient Population Expansion: The priming approach enables the treatment of a broader range of cancer patients by overcoming tumor heterogeneity.Reduced Toxicity: The ability to lower the dose of the ADC or radiopharmaceutical while maintaining efficacy reduces the risk of adverse effects and enhances patient safety.Improved Durability of Responses: By addressing tumor heterogeneity, the priming approach enhances the durability of patient responses, leading to longer-lasting remissions.By leveraging the potential of ADC and RLT (radioligand therapy), the priming approach opens up new avenues for more effective and personalized cancer treatments.Citation Format:Kathryn E.

    "abstract": "Background:Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most common lung cancer subtypes. SCC is traditionally resistant to anti-angiogenic therapies, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Nintedanib, a multi-angiokinase receptor inhibitor, is approved for treating ADC in combination with docetaxel, based on selective efficacy in the LUME-1 trial. It is also FDA-approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis due to its antifibrotic properties. Both ADC and SCC feature fibrotic stroma rich in activated tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs). Our prior work showed Nintedanib has stronger antifibrotic effects on ADC-TAFs than SCC-TAFs. However, its impact on TAF-driven angiogenesis and the role of TAFs in SCC resistance to multi-angiokinase inhibitors remain unexplored.Methods:The pro-angiogenic activity of TAFs secretome from ADC and SCC patients was assessed. TAFs were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 to mimic their activated phenotype, then treated with Nintedanib. Conditioned media from treated TAFs was used to assess endothelial cell migration and vascular network formation. Pro-angiogenic factor secretion was analyzed using antibody arrays, and functional roles of selected proteins were validated in vitro and in vivo using genetic approaches.Results:Nintedanib inhibited the pro-angiogenic effects of ADC-TAF secretome but paradoxically enhanced angiogenesis in SCC-TAFs, increasing endothelial cell migration in vitro and in vivo. Notably, Nintedanib selectively upregulated CXCL-1 secretion in SCC-TAFs. Silencing CXCL-1 using siRNA in SCC-TAFs abrogated the Nintedanib-induced angiogenesis. Similar findings with other multi-angiokinase inhibitors suggest aberrant CXCL-1 production in SCC-TAFs may drive universal resistance to these therapies.Conclusion:SCC-TAFs are resistant to the anti-angiogenic effects of Nintedanib, which paradoxically promotes angiogenesis via CXCL-1 upregulation. This study provides the first mechanistic insight into SCC resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies and underscores the critical role of TAFs in modulating therapeutic responses. Targeting CXCL-1 or TAF-mediated pathways may inform alternative anti-angiogenic strategies in SCC, potentially in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.Citation Format:Natalia Isabel Diaz Valdivia, Paula Duch, Alejandro Bernardo, Marselina Arshakyan, Noemi Reguart, Derek Radisky, Oriol Casanovas, Jordi Alcaraz.

    "abstract": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are an innovative class of biopharmaceuticals which combine the potency of cytotoxic molecules with the targeted specificity of monoclonal antibodies. The success of a traditional ADC not only hinges on tumor antigen-specific binding but internalization to maximize cytotoxicity from the payload and minimize off-target damage to healthy tissue. The development of an ADC therapy is a complex, multistep process that involves identifying a target antigen, discovering an ideal antibody, selecting the cytotoxic payload and linker, and optimizing the conjugation chemistry - all of which can take years from initial research to therapeutic application. One significant bottleneck within this process is the lack of early phase assays to guide the down-selection of functional antibodies from hundreds of antigen binding clones. Therefore, developing an efficient high-throughput assay for antibody internalization is crucial for accelerating ADC development. The Beacon\u00ae optofluidic platform from Bruker Cellular Analysis is an advanced solution for this problem that enables researchers to identify valuable monoclonal antibodies within a week, bypassing the time consuming and laborious process of hybridoma library generation and screening. With this platform, tens of thousands of single primary cells can be isolated using Opto-Electronic Positioning (OEP) technology and assayed for antibody secretion, antigen binding, and receptor-specific internalization in live reporter cells within a single day. This cutting-edge technology is the only platform capable of screening and measuring >10, 000 antibodies simultaneously for rapid internalization (1-2 hours). We showcase the ability to streamline early-phase discovery of internalizing antibodies, going beyond mere antigen specificity to enable high-throughput, real-time evaluation of functional antibodies. The Beacon optofluidic platform significantly reduces hands-on time and resource expenditure, focusing efforts on the most promising ADC candidates for downstream characterization and optimization, ultimately expediting the progression of ideal antibodies into clinical applications.Citation Format:Brittany Benlian, Leqian Liu, Alexander Mastroianni, Minha Park, Vincent Pai, Alireza Salmanzadeh.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND:HER2-positive gastric and breast cancers often develop resistance to the approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). Disitamab vedotin (DV), a novel anti-HER2 ADC, binds to a distinct epitope on HER2 compared to trastuzumab. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of DV in preclinical models of gastric and breast cancer, including those resistant to T-DM1 and T-DXd and explored whether combining DV with these ADCs could enhance anti-tumor efficacy.METHODS:We evaluated the efficacy of DV, T-DM1, and T-DXd individually and in combination using AlamarBlue cell proliferation assays in HER2-positive gastric and breast cancer cell lines, including models resistant to T-DM1 and T-DXd. We assessed the in vivo efficacy of DV in SCID mouse xenograft models of gastric and breast cancer that had progressed on T-DM1 and/or T-DXd. We examined dual combinations of the three ADCs in xenograft models to evaluate potential synergistic effects.RESULTS:DV demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in both in vitro and in vivo models, including cell lines and xenografts that were resistant to T-DM1 and T-DXd. In xenograft models, DV effectively inhibited tumor growth in cancers that had progressed following treatment with T-DM1 and/or T-DXd. Notably, combining DV with either T-DM1 or T-DXd resulted in superior anti-tumor effects compared to the use of single agents alone, both in cell culture and in xenograft studies.CONCLUSIONS:This study highlights the effectiveness of DV in overcoming resistance to T-DM1 and T-DXd in preclinical models of HER2-positive gastric and breast cancer. The combination of DV with these ADCs demonstrated enhanced efficacy, underscoring the potential of dual ADC strategies to improve outcomes in HER2-positive cancers.Citation Format:Negar Pourjamal, Vadim Le Joncour, Gy\u00f6rgy Vereb, Cilla Honkamaki, Jorma Isola, Jeffrey V Leyton, Pirjo Laakkonen, Heikki Joensuu, Mark Barok.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) have had tremendous impact on patient outcomes in breast and other cancers. T-DXd, for example, is second-line therapy for stage IV, HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer as well as HER2 low expressing tumors. Sacituzumab govitecan, a TROP2 targeted ADC, has been approved as a 3rd line therapy in locally advanced or metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer. However, many patients fail to respond or relapse after treatment with ADC therapies due to tumor heterogeneity and eventual resistance to the ADC payload. We are developing next generation Multi-Payload Conjugates\u2122 (MPCs\u2122) that deliver targeted combination chemotherapies within a single molecule to address shortcomings in current ADCs.Method:CatenaBio has developed novel, highly stable, single-molecule targeted combination therapies, MPCs\u2122, with tunable payload ratios. Our selective conjugation platform allows the attachment of distinct payloads targeting different mechanisms of action at three unique sites on antibody scaffolds.Results:Catena\u2019s MPCs show superior inhibition and excellent tolerability in mouse models of tumor growth in HER2 high and HER2 low/TROP2 expressing xenograft models including models of TNBC (triple negative breast cancer). In head-to-head comparisons MPCs out-perform current standards of care T-DXd and sacituzumab govitecan, demonstrating tumor elimination at low mg/kg doses. To produce the MPCs, combinations of different payloads targeting orthogonal mechanisms of cell division attached to trastuzumab as well as sacituzumab were screened at different DARs and payload ratios to optimize tumor cell killing. These targeted combination ADCs demonstrated robust killing in multiple cell lines containing high and low expression of HER2 and TROP2, as well as a T-DXd resistant cell line.Conclusion:While advances have been made in the design of ADCs to expand to previously unaddressed populations, high patient relapse and the failure of recent mono-payload ADCs in late-stage trials indicate a need for novel conjugate modalities. Multi-payload Conjugates\u2122 offer the next step in ADC design and allow for the targeted combination of multiple mechanisms of action with a single MPC\u2122 that are highly efficacious at eliminating tumors across multiple cell line derived xenograft models with a range of target expression. Successfully constructed with a variety of targeting antibodies, these molecules offer the potential to circumvent tumor resistance pathways to deliver deeper and more durable patient responses.Citation Format:Richard L.

    "abstract": "Background:Cell-cell adhesion molecule cadherin-6 (CDH6), a member of the CDH family, is expressed in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells and mediates calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Although the function of CDH6 has not been fully elucidated, it is believed to be associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis during tumor development. CDH6 is upregulated in various cancers, including ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma, while its expression in normal tissues is limited. The therapeutic potential of CDH6 as an ADC target was recently unraveled by DS-6000a, a Dxd-based ADC from Daiichi/MSD. In this study, we present the development of a novel CDH6 ADC that is in the IND enabling stage. The new ADC demonstrates a superior safety profile compared to DS-6000a and shows robust anti-tumor activities in preclinical studies.Method:QLS5133 is built on the QILU's proprietary novel topoisomerase-1(TOPO 1) inhibitor QLS6917 platform, with site-specific conjugation to yield a uniform DAR 8 product. The payload QLS6916 displayed nanomolar activity across various cancer cell lines and much faster systematic clearance than Dxd in vitro.Result:QLS5133 exhibited a higher affinity and internalization compared to DS-6000a. Treatment with QLS5133 induced significant tumor regressions in multiple CDH6-expressing human cancer cell line xenograft studies encompassing ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Notably, in one CDX model with ultralow and highly heterogeneous CDH6 expression, QLS5133 still demonstrated strong efficacy. Additionally, QLS5133 was able to achieve a durable response even after resistance to Mirvetuximab soravtansine (FR\u03b1 ADC/ImmunoGen) in preclinical models. This suggests that QLS5133 could potentially serve as a late-line treatment following treatment failure with Mirvetuximab soravtansine. More importantly, QLS5133 showed much less severe hematotoxicity than DS-6000a particularly regarding changes in platelets, white blood cells, neutrophils, as well as having a lesser impact on body weight reduction when dosed up to 80 mg/kg (single dose administration) in cyno monkeys. Meanwhile, QLS5133 demonstrated a better PK profile than DS-6000a in cyno monkeys, with longer T1/2 and slower systematic clearance as intact ADC, and sustained DAR retention for a period of 21 days.Conclusion:The promising efficacy, superior tolerability, and favorable PK profile support the potential of QLS5133 as a novel therapeutic agent to address the high unmet needs in patients with variable CDH6-expressing cancers. QLS5133 will enter clinical trials.Citation Format:Ying Huang, Fanrui Meng, Liuqing Yang, Shuyong Zhao, Xinmei Wang, Ling Zhang, Yang Yang, Hua Ying, Weikang Tao.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a pivotal advancement in biotherapy, leveraging targeted internalization to treat tumors effectively. A critical phenomenon associated with ADCs is the bystander effect, where cytotoxic drugs released from lysed cancer cells diffuse into neighboring tumor cells, enhancing therapeutic efficacy\u2014particularly in tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression. Despite its significance, methods for detecting and evaluating the bystander effect of ADCs remain under development. In this study, we present a robust approach to monitor and analyze the bystander effect of ADCs in real-time using live-cell imaging and impedance measurements with the Agilent xCELLigence RTCA eSight system. Two innovative assays\u2014the in vitro co-culture assay and the conditioned medium transfer assay\u2014were established for this purpose. The cytotoxic effects of DS8201, an ADC with bystander activity, and T-DM1, an ADC without bystander activity, were assessed in these assays. In the co-culture assay, HER2-positive SKBR3 cells and HER2-negative MCF7 cells were co-seeded in a biosensor plate (E-Plate VIEW 96) the day before testing. The results revealed that DS8201 treatment led to the death of HER2-negative MCF7 cells in the presence of SKBR3 cells, indicative of a bystander effect. In contrast, T-DM1 did not affect MCF7 viability under similar conditions. Both DS8201 and T-DM1, however, induced cytotoxicity in HER2-positive SKBR3 cells. In the conditioned medium transfer assay, medium from SKBR3 cells treated with DS8201 significantly reduced MCF7 cell viability, demonstrating a bystander effect. Conversely, conditioned medium from T-DM1-treated SKBR3 cells did not impact MCF7 viability. Notably, neither DS8201 nor T-DM1 exhibited direct cytotoxic effects on MCF7 cells in isolation. In conclusion, we describe two robust methodologies for detecting and evaluating the bystander effect of ADCs using the RTCA eSight system. These approaches provide valuable tools for optimizing the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of therapeutic ADCs during biopharmaceutical development.Citation Format:Xiaoyu Zhang, Yun-fei Pu, Tian Wang, Grace Yang, Peifang Ye, Nancy Li.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have revolutionized cancer therapies by enabling the targeted delivery of cytotoxic payloads to tumor cells. However, their efficacy and safety heavily rely on the toxins as their payloads, and the rare availability of toxin types often limits their efficacy and broader expansion of indications. Combining the precision targeting feature of ADCs and diverse options of protein degraders, degrader-antibody conjugates (DACs) have emerged as a next-generation therapeutic modality and offer a promising strategy to overcome these challenges. The human trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein widely expressed in various types of tumors. It has been clinically proven as a well-suited antigen for ADCs with its widespread overexpression in cancer cells and much lower expression in normal cells. Despite the clinical success of Trop2-targeting ADCs like IMMU-132 (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy), their dependence on topoisomerase inhibitors as payloads has exposed significant limitations, particularly in addressing both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. This has created an urgent need for innovative therapeutic solutions. Here we introduce DAC-1522, a novel Trop2-directed DAC, that can potentially overcome the limitations of ADCs. In vitro studies have shown that DAC-1522 efficiently degrades the target protein in a dose-dependent manner and exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against multiple human cancer cell lines. Its efficacy is strongly correlated with the level of Trop2, ensuring selective cytotoxicity in Trop2-positive cells and sparing Trop2-negative cells, resulting in a favorable therapeutic window. Notably, DAC-1522 retains uncompromised antiproliferative activity in an ADC-induced acquired drug resistance model, underscoring its potential to overcome the drug resistance after ADC treatments. In vivo, DAC-1522 achieves complete tumor regression with a single intravenous injection in mice (human pancreatic cancer BXPC-3 xenograft model), significantly outperforming IMMU-132 in terms of efficacy. No obvious safety concerns were observed. These findings support further preclinical and clinical development of DAC-1522 as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the Trop2-expressing cancers.Citation Format:Chuanjie Chen, Qianqian Shen, Xinhui Cai, Yaqi Ding, Xiaoyu Yang, Yanfen Fang, Jiangnan Luo, Jian Ding, Yi Chen, Xuan Zhang.

    "abstract": "Purpose:HER2 is amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer (BC) and other cancers where it promotes proliferation and mediates resistance to targeted therapies. A combination of anti-HER2 trastuzumab and pertuzumab is approved for treatment.Aim:To develop and evaluate a combination antibody-drug radioconjugates (ADRs) [225Ac]Ac-Macropa-trastuzumab-PEG6-DM1 ([225Ac]Ac-Macropa-T-PEG6-DM1) and [225Ac]Ac-Macropa-pertuzumab-PEG6-DM1 ([225Ac]Ac-Macropa-P-PEG6-DM1) against HER2-positive BC.Experimental Design:Therapeutics [225Ac]Ac-Macropa-T-PEG6-DM1 and [225Ac]Ac-Macropa-P-PEG6-DM1 and their respective imaging pairs [89Zr]Zr-DFO-trastuzumab-PEG6-DM1 and [67Cu]Cu-DOTA-pertuzumab-PEG6-DM1 were developed and characterized. Biodistribution and toxicological evaluation of [225Ac]Ac-Macropa-T-PEG6-DM1 and [225Ac]Ac-Macropa-P-PEG6-DM1 were carried out in healthy female Balb/C mice. Dual microPET/SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution using [89Zr]Zr-DFO-T-PEG6-DM1 and [67Cu]Cu-DOTA-P-PEG6-DM1 was performed in female athymic Balb/C nude mice bearing HCC1954 and JIMT-1 xenografts. Therapy was carried out using ADCs (T-PEG6-DM1 + P-PEG6-DM1) and ADRs ([225Ac]Ac-Macropa-T-PEG6-DM1 + [225Ac]Ac-Macropa-P-PEG6-DM1 = [225Ac]Ac-Macropa-(T+P)-PEG6-DM1) in athymic Balb/C nude mice bearing trastuzumab-resistant HCC1954 (high HER2 density) and T-DM1/trastuzumab-resistant JIMT-1 (medium HER2 density) tumors.Results:Internalization in HCC1954 and JIMT-1 cells was HER2 density-dependent, with the highest total red object area values recorded with the ADC combination (T-ADC + P-ADC) compared with the single agents (p < 0.0001). Dual microPET/SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-T-PEG6-DM1 and [67Cu]Cu-DOTA-P-PEG6-DM1 showed very high tumor uptake in both HCC1954 and JIMT-1 xenografts with high tumor-non-target ratios. The combination of ADCs (T-ADC + P-ADC) and ADRs ([225Ac]Ac-Macropa-(T+P)-PEG6-DM1) administered separately in healthy Balb/C mice, 10 days apart was well tolerated biochemically and haematologically for 20 days (d). Compared with the individual agents, there was improved non-target clearance using the combined ADRs [225Ac]Ac-Macropa-(T+P)-PEG6-DM1. In HCC1954-tumor bearing mice, all treatment groups had complete remission (CR) after 29d and 22d for (T-PEG6-DM1 + P-PEG6-DM1) and ADRs ([225Ac]Ac-Macropa-(T+P)-PEG6-DM1) respectively. Interestingly, in JIMT-1 xenografts at 60d post treatment, no CR was observed for the ADCs group whereas in the ADRs group, the average tumor volume was 11.5 \u00b1 4.4 mm3 with 3/8 CRs.Conclusion:[225Ac]Ac-Macropa-(T+P)-PEG6-DM1 is more potent than their respective combined ADCs against HER2-positive BC and warrants further evaluation.Citation Format:Jessica Pougoue Ketchemen, Alissar Monzer, Fabrice Ngoh Njotu, Hanan Babeker, Emmanuel Nwangele, Anjong Florence Tikum, Nikita Henning, Nava Hassani, Alireza Doroudi, Humphrey Fonge.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine targeted delivery with potent cytotoxic payloads, utilizing multiple mechanisms of action (MoA). These include direct cytotoxicity following internalization of the ADC by antigen-expressing cells, killing of bystander cells through cleaved payloads, antigen function blockade, and immune-mediated cytotoxicity (e.g. Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis) driven by the antibody Fc region. Comprehensive characterization and potency testing of ADCs require assays that capture each MoA. To address this need, we developed bioluminescent tools to streamline ADC evaluation, focusing on antibody internalization, Fc-mediated effector functions, and bystander killing. Studying bystander killing is particularly important in immunotherapy strategies for cancer, as it allows ADCs to target heterogenous tumors where not all cells express the antigen. The internalization assay employs luciferase-labeled Fab fragments with a quenching mechanism to measure intracellular antibody localization. The assay was validated using HER2-expressing SKOV3 cells with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies as model systems. It shows strong time- and antigen-dependent luminescence, achieving over 100-fold signal increases compared to controls, enabling quantitative ADC screening. Additional assays include Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays and cell-based reporter bioassays for ADCC and ADCP activities. The HiBiT technology is a luminescent tagging system that enables precise and sensitive detection of protein interactions and cellular events, making it a powerful tool for evaluating Target Cell Killing (TCK) by effectors and cytotoxic payloads carried by antibodies. To assess payload efficacy, a HiBiT-enabled bystander killing assay was developed, distinguishing ADCs with varying payload properties. Taken together, the internalization assay, bystander killing assay, and Fc effector bioassays, all based on bioluminescent platforms, offer a comprehensive and high-throughput solution for evaluating ADC functionality. With exceptional sensitivity, broad dynamic range, and efficient workflows, these tools enable precise optimization of therapeutic efficacy, delivering significant value for preclinical ADC development.Citation Format:Julia K.

    "abstract": "Background:Biparatopic antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) can provide many functional benefits over their traditional monoparatopic counterparts including increased binding, greater cell surface decoration, superior receptor blockade, and enhanced internalization and payload delivery; however, not all antigens are amenable to biparatopic targeting. We sought to leverage our prior knowledge of biparatopic antibody development and our AzymetricTM technology to develop a novel biparatopic ADC against protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) that could provide a functional enhancement over monoparatopic ADCs. PTK7 is an attractive ADC target due to preliminary clinical activity demonstrated with cofetuzumab peledotin in non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and metastatic breast cancer and evidence that PTK7 is overexpressed in other solid tumor indications including esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, and cervical cancer.Materials and Methods:Twenty-nine PTK7-targeting paratopes were isolated from a mouse antibody discovery campaign and paratope pairs were combined into a panel of biparatopic antibodies using AzymetricTM Het_Fc mutations. A high-throughput screen was used to assess the functional properties of these antibodies and to identify the top paratope combinations. ADCs were produced by conjugating the top biparatopic and monoparatopic antibodies to ZD06519, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload used in ZW191, an ADC targeting FR\u03b1 under evaluation in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06555744). ADC activity was investigated in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments using ovarian, lung, and breast cancer models.Results:Across multiple cancer cell lines with varying PTK7 expression we compared a lead monoparatopic antibody and cofetuzumab with the top biparatopic antibody which demonstrated greater cell surface decoration and better internalization. At clinically relevant doses, the biparatopic ZD06519 ADC was more efficacious than cofetuzumab pelidotin in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer cell line derived xenograft models. Additional studies of the PTK7 biparatopic ADC in patient-derived xenograft models and a non-human primate tolerability study are planned.Citation Format:Luying Yang, Vincent Fung, Alex Wu, Dunja Urosev, Saki Konomura, Tik Nga Tong, Katina Mak, Elizabeth M.

    "abstract": "Background:Her2 and c-Met, two tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), are well-established cancer targets, as evidenced by the approval of several anti-Her2 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a bispecific anti-c-Met/EGFR antibody, and promising Phase 2 efficacy of an anti-c-Met ADC. Her2 and c-Met are expressed separately or co-expressed in various cancer types, including lung, pancreatic and kidney cancers, reflecting the heterogeneity of tumor TAA expression. Dual TAA-targeting may reduce the probability of cancer escape, commonly seen in the treatment of single TAA-targeting ADCs, due to the heterogeneity of TAA expression.Methods:We developed a novel bispecific anti-Her2/anti-c-Met ADC, BB-205. BB-205 was engineered using humanized anti-Her2 and anti-c-Met VHH fragments, fused with a human IgG1 Fc, and conjugated with vc-MMAE. Whole cell binding assays were conducted to determine the binding affinity of BB-205 to TAAs. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of BB-205 on various cancer cell lines. The in vivo efficacy of BB-205 was tested in HPAC and NCI-H1975 xenograft mouse models.Results:BB-205 maintained the high binding affinities of its parental VHH-Fc antibodies to Her2 and c-Met. It exhibited remarkable cytotoxic effects on cancer cells that express either Her2 or c-Met, or both. Its cytotoxic potency was comparable to Trastuzumab-MMAE (T-MMAE) in Her2-high expressing cancer cells and to Telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso-V) in c-Met-high expressing cancer cells. BB-205 demonstrated superior cytotoxicity than either reference ADC or combination of both reference ADCs in dual TAA-expressing cancer cells with low to medium level of expression. Additionally, BB-205 showed higher internalization compared to either reference ADC in cancer cells. In the in vivo HPAC xenograft model, where HPAC cells express medium levels of c-Met and low levels of Her2, both BB-205 and Teliso-V significantly inhibited tumor growth, achieving 100% and 91% tumor growth inhibition (TGI), respectively. In contrast, treatments with T-MMAE had a low efficacy in suppression of tumor growth. At the end of study, 50% of mice in the BB-205 group were tumor-free, whereas no mice in other groups were tumor-free. BB-205 was also tested in an NCI-H1975 xenograft model, where NCI-H1975 cells express medium levels of Her2 and c-Met. Treatment with either BB-205 or T-MMAE significantly reduced tumor size. Four weeks after a single dose, 50% mice in BB-205 group and 25% mice in T-MMAE group were tumor-free. While Teliso-V initially shrank tumors, the tumors gradually regrew in the fifth week post-treatment. No obvious side effects were observed in both in vivo studies.Conclusions:The novel anti-Her2/anti-c-Met bispecific ADC BB-205 demonstrates superior anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies. BB-205 shows promising therapeutic potential as a first-in-class ADC drug candidate.Citation Format:Hongyan Zhong, Daniel Li, Daniel Guo, Phuong Nguyen, Ming Yang.

    "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have been extensively studied as anticancer agents that selectively induce cancer cell death by disabling complementary DNA repair pathways. Despite PARPi\u2019s initial effectiveness, tumors often develop drug resistance, limiting the long-term effectiveness of these drugs. Combining PARPi with chemotherapeutics or other DNA damage response inhibitors have been explored to enhance the efficacy and overcome resistance. However, these combinations had significantly more side effects, highlighting the need for innovative therapeutic approaches that preserve anti-tumor efficacy while minimizing side effects. Incorporating PARPi as a payload within an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) may offer a promising strategy for targeted delivery to tumor cells, to overcome drug resistance and to reduce systemic toxicity. To establish proof-of-concept, a TROP2 antibody was conjugated with a PARP1 selective inhibitor using a cleavable linker. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were conducted in MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468, and HCC1937 cell lines to compare the effects with the naked mAb, ADC, and free payload. An in vivo efficacy study was conducted using the MDA-MB-436 subcutaneous xenograft model in NOD-SCID mice. The PARPi payload was confirmed to be PARP1 selective via surface plasmon resonance and trapping assays. In vitro, ADC demonstrated potent cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-436 cells, which are known to be PARPi-sensitive with low levels of TROP2 expression, with an IC50 value of approximately 1 nM, whereas the naked mAb showed no cytotoxicity. In contrast, MDA-MB-468 and HCC1937 cells (with high levels of TROP2 expression and homologous recombination proficiency) showed cytotoxicity, only with free payload at high concentrations. In vivo, ADC and the free payload induced tumor regression and sustained antitumor effects, whereas the naked TROP2 mAb showed no efficacy. Hematological analysis reveals that the ADC-treated groups showed improved side effects compared to the free payload group. This study highlights the potential of a PARP1 selective inhibitor as an ADC payload, utilizing ADC as a drug delivery system, to achieve substantial antitumor activity with reduced side effects in vitro and in vivo. These findings emphasize the enhanced safety of PARP1i-based ADC compared to standalone PARP1 inhibitor, enabling novel strategies such as combination therapies or dual-payload ADC apporaches to effectively overcome drug resistance.Citation Format:Jina Koo, Jeong Eun Kim, Hyeon Woong Park, Won Sik Lee, Myongjae Lee.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancer (BC) is an important biomarker for a better decision making of anti-HER2 therapy. Trastuzumab has been the standard of care treatment for HER2 positive patients, but recently new antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have given an alternative option in clinical practice. Since ADCs efficacy is due to HER2 antibody localization and internalization in the cell, we hypothesize that cellular sensitivity to the drug may be linked to cellular vesicle trafficking systems and membrane protrusions which indicate the resistance of HER2 internalization. Super resolution fluorescence microscope named HM-1000 achieves a resolution less than 20 nm. With this new tool, we aim to study the intracellular distribution pattern of HER2 including vesicle-like structures and membrane protrusions to better identify responders of anti-HER2 therapies, especially ADCs.Method:A retrospective unicentric study is designed to recruit BC patients who have received ADCs treatment that have formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples stored for routine diagnosis. 5 baseline tumor samples were stained by commercialized HER2 in situ immunofluorescence, and O2 scavenging buffer was applied and sealed to capture the fluorescent blinking every 30 milliseconds by HM-1000. The 50, 000 image frames per microscopic field were processed using ImageJ software and created super-resolution images.Results:We observed that HER2 signals from ADCs responding patients exhibit predominant membrane localization, especially in those with 3+ immunohistochemistry staining status, compared to ADCs non-responding HER2 3+ cases which show low membrane localization of HER2 and more intracellular distribution. Additionally, this finding is highlighted by intense membrane protrusions in HER2 3+ tumor which present very good response of ADCs.Conclusion:We found different HER2 localization in ADC responding and non-responding patients. The presence of membrane protrusions may facilitate HER2 targeted antibody binding and induce both cellular cytotoxicity from immune effector cells and endocytosis of cytotoxic drug, which explains ADCs response. Further studies are needed to support this finding and better predict the effectiveness of ADCs therapies in HER2 positive tumors.Citation Format:Vicente Peg, Yuko Saruta, Yun Li, Santiago Ramon y Cajal.

    "abstract": "Tissue factor (TF) is an integral membrane protein, normally separated from the blood by the vascular endothelium, which plays a key role in the initiation of blood coagulation. However, TF is aberrantly expressed in solid tumors and its expression associated with poor prognosis. The first TF targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) , a microtubule inhibitor based ADC(MTI-ADC), is approved for the treatment of cervical cancer. It had several prespecified adverse effects (AEs) including bleeding risks, ocular toxicity and perpheral neuropathy, the last two of which were known MMAE related AEs. In order to mitigate the safety concerns, we developed a novel ADC, SYS6051. It was composed of a humanized TF-targeting IgG1 antibody site-specifically conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (Exatecan) at a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 6 via a protease-cleavable linker. In addition, SYS6051 had improved resistance towards retro-Michael elimination reactions, resulting in improved stability compared to cysteine thiol-maleimide conjugated ADCs. The naked SYS6051-mAb did not interfere with the interaction among TF, Factor FVII and Factor X, and had no impact on coagulation cascade. SYS6051-mAb could quickly enter cells through endocytosis 3 hours after treatment, faster than the antibody of the MTI-ADC. Treatment with SYS6051 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in a panel of TF-positive cell line derived xenografts (CDXs), including pancreatic and cervical cancer xenografts. Furthermore, SYS6051 was well tolerated in a toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey at dosages \u226430 mg/kg. A stable PK profile of SYS6051 was also observed in NHP. Neither coagulation disorder nor skin rash was observed, superior to the historical toxicity data in NHP of the MTI-ADC. Taken together, SYS6051 has a wide therapeutic window because of promising efficacy, higher tolerability, stable PK profile, and could potentially provide benefits for the patients carrying TF positive malignancies.Citation Format:Xiaojuan Wu, Mingyue Shen, Mo Dan, Xiwu Hui, Bing Yao, Yanling Li, Wei Yang, Hanqian Xu, Can Yuan, Yufei Sun, Bin Kang, Yang Zhang, Linlin Xiao.

    "abstract": "Targeting tumor associated antigens (TAA) with highly potent cytotoxic payloads by Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) technology is revolutionizing cancer treatment. Whether ADC could replace current chemotherapy as the standard partner of radiotherapy (RT) remain elusive. We sought to systematically decipher the impact of different payload classes and ADC combinations on tumor response to RT. A broad matrix of frequently targeted TAAs including EGFR, HER2, HER3, TROP2, Nectin4 and CEACAM in prototypic cancer cell lines representing different entities, including squamous cell carcinoma (A431), breast cancer (AU565, BT474, MDA-MB-361 and 231, MCF-7), lung cancer (NCI-H1975, A549), gastric cancer (NCI-N87) and pancreatic cancer (BxPC3) were evaluated. Moreover, representative payloads classes, i.e., tubulin inhibitors (MMAE and DM1/4), topoisomerase I inhibitors (DXd and SN-38), and the alkylating agent duocarmycin were examined. Accordingly, combination of RT with ADCs targeting HER2: trastuzumab emtansine/deruxtecan/duocarmazine (T-DM1/T-DXd/T-Duo) and disitamab vedotin, TROP2: datopotamab deruxtecan and sacituzumab govitecan, EGFR: depatuxizumab MMAE, HER3: patritumab deruxtecan, Nectin4: enfortumab vedotin and CEACAM5: tusamitamab ravtansine were evaluated. A broad heterogeneity in sensitivity to payload classes was found e.g., for topoisomerase inhibitor Deruxtecan a low nM (3, 3 nM) IC50 was observed in sensitive A431. In contrast, 1 \u00b5M Deruxtecan led to only 20% loss of viability in resistant BT474 cells. In line, BT474 showed resistance to HER2 targeting ADC with topoisomerase inhibitor payload (T-DXd) but was sensitive to the same antibody conjugated with tubulin inhibitor payloads (T-DM1). These data indicate that not only TAA presence and density but also intrinsic payload sensitivity maybe relevant for assessment of ADC efficacy. Consequently, in tumors sensitive to both tubulin and topoisomerase inhibitors like AU565 breast cancer cell line similar \u223c 65% cytotoxicity was found at 1 nM to both T-DM1 and T-DXd, regardless of the payload substance class. The relevance of TAA targeting, payload and drug antibody ratio (DAR) was further demonstrated by comparing different ADCs vs. antibody vs. payload alone. Enhanced radiosensitivity was exploited for different ADC and substance classes e.g., MMAE and SN-38 IC50 concentrations led to >2-Fold reduction of the survival fraction (SF) of A431 cells when combined with 2Gy RT. Together, this study demonstrates that inherent sensitivity of tumor cells to different payload classes, DAR and TAA dynamic are of relevance for the efficacy of ADC. Informed selection of ADC exhibited synergistic effects with RT providing a novel multimodal and promising strategy for efficient cancer eradication.Citation Format:Allegra Gerharz, Julian Schlegel, Christiane Rutenberg, Claudia Rittm\u00fcller, Mahmoud Moustafa, Ivana Dokic, J\u00fcrgen Debus, Amir Abdollahi.

We generated ADCs targeting leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), a cancer stem cell biomarker that is highly overexpressed in CRC. LGR5 ADCs demonstrated high specificity and efficacy in CRC cells and xenograft models without notable toxicity, although tumors eventually relapsed following treatment cessation. Interestingly, FDA-approved therapies targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been shown to increase LGR5 expression in patient-derived models of CRC. This study therefore aims to determine the mechanisms of EGFR-mediated regulation of LGR5 expression and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapies in combination with LGR5 ADCs for the improved treatment of CRC. We have demonstrated that cetuximab (CTX), an EGFR-targeting mAb approved for KRASWT metastatic CRC (mCRC), increases LGR5 protein levels independent of KRAS/PIK3CA mutational status in CRC cell lines, tumor organoids, and cell line-derived xenografts. Additionally, we identified a novel EGFR-LGR5 interaction that is enhanced by CTX treatment. Furthermore, we have generated a camptothecin-based LGR5 ADC (8E11-CPT2) utilizing site-specific conjugation technology that demonstrates target- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity in CRC cells and was well-tolerated. Importantly, combination treatment of 8E11-CPT2 with CTX in RASmut CRC patient-derived xenograft models significantly reduced tumor burden with notable regression in some mice and extended survival compared to LGR5 ADC and CTX monotherapies. These results demonstrate that combination treatments of LGR5 ADCs with CTX may prove more effective than ADC monotherapies in treating CRC and implicate expanded clinical utility for CTX to treat mCRCs with KRAS and/or PIK3CA mutations.Citation Format:Peyton High, Zhengdong Liang, Cara Guernsey-Biddle, Adela Aldana, Yukimatsu Toh, Qingyun Liu, Kendra S.

    "abstract": "Background:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are targeted therapies that deliver cytotoxic payloads to cells expressing specific antigens. Despite their increasing use in clinical trials for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many patients experience suboptimal outcomes. While ADC efficacy depends on factors such as antibodies, linkers and payloads, the impact of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear. This study uses spatial transcriptomics (ST) to investigate the spatial dynamics influencing ADC efficacy within the TME of NSCLC.Methods:Visium ST datasets from 36 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues were analyzed to identify factors influencing ADC efficacy. Key indices included Target Specificity Score (TSS), which reflects the ratio of target expression in malignant versus normal epithelial cells; Target-Linker Match Score (TLM), which measures overlap between target regions and linker enzyme activity; Therapeutic Index (TI), calculated as TSS \u00d7 TLM; and Intratumoral Target Expression (ITE), which quantifies average target expression. To evaluate the bystander effect, Moran's I index assessed spatial clustering patterns of target expression, and Minimum Target-High Distance (MTHD) assessed the average of the minimum distance from low to high target expression regions. Fifteen ADCs were selected from NSCLC clinical trial data, including targets, linkers, and overall response rates (ORRs). Correlations between spatial indices and ORRs were analyzed to validate the utility of the indices.Results:Of the 36 tissues analyzed, 3 were excluded due to insufficient or excessive tumor regions. Among the six indices evaluated, only MTHD showed a strong negative correlation with the reported ORRs (Spearman's R: -0.715, p = 0.003). This suggests that shorter distances between low and high target expression regions are associated with improved ADC efficacy, highlighting the critical role of spatial homogeneity in the bystander effect. To further evaluate the potential of the indices in identifying ADCs with poor therapeutic efficacy, we compared the indices between ADCs with ORR values below the 10th percentile (ORR Low) and those above (ORR High); only the TSS showed a significant difference (p < 0.05). ROC analysis identified a TSS cut-off value of 4.744, yielding an AUC of 0.962 for discriminating between ORR Low and High groups.Conclusion:Spatial indices derived from spatial transcriptomics, particularly those reflecting target specificity and bystander effect, were found to significantly influence treatment response and predict ADC failure, respectively. This in silico modeling approach offers a promising screening method to identify ADCs with the highest potential for therapeutic efficacy.Citation Format:Sungwoo Bae, Minki Choi, Hongyoon Choi, Dongjoo Lee, Kwon Joong Na, Daeseung Lee.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), comprised of cancer cell-specific antibodies linked to cytotoxic drugs, represent an innovative and promising class of anticancer agents. ADCs often rely on high receptor numbers for target binding, followed by internalization and release of the payload to exert a tumor-targeted, intracellular effect. Determination of the exact number of receptors per cell is therefore highly valuable in the context of ADCs. Here, we focused on the quantification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), since expression of this target is often amplified in various tumor types. Two HER2-targeting ADCs, i.e., ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd), have already been approved for clinical use, while roughly twenty HER2-targeting ADCs are currently under investigation. The development and improvement of ADCs could benefit from in vitro studies investigating the internalization, cytotoxic effect and possible bystander effect of ADCs related to receptor numbers. The number of HER2 per cell was quantified in a panel of thirteen cancer cell lines originating from different cancer types. The cell lines BxPC-3, CAL-27, COLO 205, HCC1954, HEC-251, K-562, MOLM-13, NCI-H23, RT-112, SK-BR-3, SK-OV-3, SW837 and U-87MG ATCC were cultured for one week in the supplier\u2019s recommended medium. Quantification of the number of surface-expressed receptors was performed with flow cytometry using Quantibrite PE beads and PE-conjugated ErbB2/HER2 antibody. The effect of T-DM1 and T-DXd on the viability of HER2 high-, intermediate- and low-expressing cells was determined in proliferation assays in 9-point dose ranges. Three independent flow cytometry experiments revealed that the breast and ovarian cancer cell lines HCC1954, SK-BR-3, and SK-OV-3 expressed the highest number of HER2 per cell, ranging between 20, 000 and 53, 000 receptors. Intermediate expression was observed on the COLO 205, HEC-251, RT-112 and SW837 cell lines, with a range of 1800 to 3800 receptors per cell. BxPC-3, CAL-27, K-562, MOLM-13, NCI-H23 and U-87MG ATCC belong to the group with the lowest or no expression of HER2, ranging up to 400 receptors per cell. T-DM1 and T-DXd induced efficient cell death in cells expressing high receptor numbers, while little or no effect was observed in cell lines with intermediate, low or no expression of HER2. Since high target expression is correlated with higher efficacy for several ADCs, as shown for T-DM1 and T-DXd is our study, this indicates that HCC1954, SK-BR-3 or SK-OV-3 cells could serve as an attractive model to study HER2 internalization. Moreover, co-cultures of HER2-positive and HER2-negative cells could aid in the investigation of ADC bystander effect. This research demonstrates the importance of receptor number quantification in the context of ADCs and may therefore contribute to future ADC development.Citation Format:Mandy W.

    "abstract": "Sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2B (NaPi2b; SLC34A2) is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including lung carcinomas, ovarian, and endometrial cancers with restricted normal tissue expression. Based on this differential expression profile, a proof-of-concept for an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) approach utilizing NaPi2b was achieved with lifastuzumab vedotin and upifitamab rilsodotin. Both ADCs used auristatin tubulin inhibitor payloads but have been discontinued due to adverse toxicities driven by the linker-payload technologies, resulting in reduced drug exposures impacting efficacy. To overcome these limitations in therapeutic window, Adcentrx has developed ADRX-0134, a NaPi2b-targeting next-generation ADC with a drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. ADRX-0134 is conjugated to a novel tubulin inhibitor payload AP052 with a proprietary cleavable linker utilizing Adcentrx\u2019 proprietary i-Conjugation\u00ae technology, resulting in an ADC with refined biophysical features. The antibody of ADRX-0134 was selected based on its strong nanomolar and highly specific cell binding affinity and similar cross-reactivity to cynomolgus monkey and rodent orthologs. The ADC exhibits sub-nanomolar cytotoxic activity to NaPi2b-expressing tumor cells and has a very stable PK profile with minimal deconjugation. This translates to the observed strong efficacy and durable tumor regression in mouse models of ovarian, endometrial and non-small cell lung cancers with high as well as low/heterogenous NaPi2b expression. Most notably, ADRX-0134 achieved tumor regression in settings where deruxtecan- and vedotin-based NaPi2b ADCs were insufficient. Besides the improvement in efficacy, ADRX-0134 was highly tolerated in a repeat dose non-human primate study at up to 18 mg/kg, the highest tested dose. Here, the stable TK profile ensured minimal and recoverable hematology findings, an unchanged clinical chemistry profile and normal histology of lung, liver, GI and eye, which were key safety liabilities for other NaPi2b ADCs. In summary, ADRX-0134 exhibits excellent biophysical features with highly selective and increased efficacy in NaPi2b-expressing tumors, while being well-tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys at doses that are expected to provide a widened therapeutic window over first-generation NaPi2b ADCs.Citation Format:Andrew M.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a powerful modality to increase the therapeutic index of potent chemotherapy drugs by selectively increasing drug delivery to tumor cells while minimizing exposure to non-tumor tissue. Recent advances have improved efficacy by increasing the drug-antibody ratio (DAR) and optimizing linkers to reduce payload release in plasma and increase release within tumor tissue. Despite this significant progress and the clinical success of recent ADCs, particularly in breast cancer, challenges persist, including managing toxicity and diversifying payload classes to broaden the clinical applications of ADCs. This study demonstrates the engineering and biological potency of ADCs comprised of 50-200 single or mixed kinase inhibitors, enabling the utilization of previously unusable payloads. Small molecules are linked to a specialized polymer scaffold using cathepsin-cleavable linkers and internalized by tumor cells in an antibody target-dependent manner, where they inhibit signaling pathways essential for survival. These HER2-targeted biomolecules combined with payloads inhibiting PI3K/mTOR (apitolisib) or MEK (cobimetinib) demonstrate the use of ADCs as precision medicine to selectively target cancer cells via antibody and payload. For example, many HER2-positive tumors also carry oncogenic mutations in the PI3K pathway rendering those tumors exquisitely sensitive to these ADCs, especially when HER2 expression is low. As shown in Table 1, PI3K pathway mutations can increase the sensitivity to ADCs with apitolisib as a payload, in some cases surpassing the potency of the exatecan derivative DXd in trastuzumab-DXd (DAR8). We will also present data supporting the in vivo safety and efficacy of these ADCs which may provide a novel solution to expand the therapeutic landscape, particularly for HER2-positive cancers.Table 1 Cell Line\n            .\u00a0PI3K pathway mutation\n            .\u00a0HER2 expression\n            .\u00a0DS-8201 (T-DXd) (IC50 nM)\n            .\u00a0BHS T- apitolisib DAR100 (IC50 nM)\n            .\u00a0SUM159\u00a0PIK3CA (H1047L)\u00a01+\u00a0159.7\u00a09.365\u00a0T47D\u00a0PIK3CA (H1047R)\u00a01+\u00a012.44\u00a03.859\u00a0MCF7\u00a0PIK3CA (E545K)\u00a01+\u00a0239\u00a04.944\u00a0ZR751\u00a0PTEN Missense\u00a02+\u00a011.09\u00a09.451\u00a0AU565\u00a0WT\u00a03+\u00a00.3521\u00a04.28\u00a0SKBR3\u00a0PIK3CA (H1047)\u00a03+\u00a00.4009\u00a03.346\u00a0Cell Line\n            .\u00a0PI3K pathway mutation\n            .\u00a0HER2 expression\n            .\u00a0DS-8201 (T-DXd) (IC50 nM)\n            .\u00a0BHS T- apitolisib DAR100 (IC50 nM)\n            .\u00a0SUM159\u00a0PIK3CA (H1047L)\u00a01+\u00a0159.7\u00a09.365\u00a0T47D\u00a0PIK3CA (H1047R)\u00a01+\u00a012.44\u00a03.859\u00a0MCF7\u00a0PIK3CA (E545K)\u00a01+\u00a0239\u00a04.944\u00a0ZR751\u00a0PTEN Missense\u00a02+\u00a011.09\u00a09.451\u00a0AU565\u00a0WT\u00a03+\u00a00.3521\u00a04.28\u00a0SKBR3\u00a0PIK3CA (H1047)\u00a03+\u00a00.4009\u00a03.346\u00a0\n                  View LargeCitation Format:Emmalyn Lecky, Adam Voelker, Isabella Ranieri, Andrew Kassick, Cassandra Crihfield, Christopher Fried, Destiny Carpenter, David Wilson, Robert Fryberger, Jingyi Li, Amanda Mincey, Matthew Cummings, Alex Toker, Krzysztof Matyjaszewski, Antonina Simakova, Laura E.

    "abstract": "Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) are targeted cancer therapies delivering cytotoxic agents selectively to cancer cells. Despite clinical success across various malignancies, resistance to ADC therapy limits long-term efficacy. A key ADC mechanism is inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD), releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and tumor antigens to stimulate an immune response. This provides a rationale for combining ADCs with immunotherapies to overcome resistance and improve survival rates.AWT020 is a novel fusion protein currently in Phase I clinical trials. It combines a humanized antibody targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) with a potency attenuated interleukin-2 (IL-2) mutein. This design blocks the PD-1 pathway while preferentially activating IL-2 signaling on PD-1high tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs), minimizing peripheral PD-1low lymphocyte activation and reducing systemic toxicity. In preclinical tumor models, a murine surrogate of AWT020 (mAWT020) demonstrated superior anti-tumor activity over a PD-1 monoclonal antibody by selectively expanding TILs.Both ADCs and AWT020 selectively target the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor cell killing through distinct mechanisms. We hypothesized that ADC-induced ICD could be further amplified by AWT020. To test this, we developed two syngeneic tumor models, EMT6B7H3 and EMT6Her2, expressing human B7H3 and human Her2, allowing specific ADC targeting. In the EMT6B7H3 model, combination of B7H3 ADC (B7H3-Exa) and mAWT020 eradicated all tumors after a single dose, outperforming monotherapies. Similar synergy between Her2-Exa ADC and mAWT020 was observed in the EMT6Her2 model. In a subsequent tumor rechallenge study, most mAWT020-treated mice rejected the replantation of EMT6B7H3, indicating that mAWT020 had induced long-term immunological memory in these animals. As a comparison, combination of anti-mPD-1 with B7H3-Exa did not enhance the antitumor activity of ADC. Characterization of ICD markers and TIL phenotypes in the EMT6B7H3 model showed that B7H3-Exa treatment significantly upregulated calreticulin (CRT) expression in EMT6B7H3 tumor cells. The combination of B7H3-Exa and mAWT020 further increased CRT expression. Compared to B7H3-Exa monotherapy or the combination of B7H3-Exa and anti-mPD-1, mAWT020 treated groups significantly increased CD3+ T cell infiltration within the tumor, as well as tumor-specific T cells, as detected by ELISpot assay.These preclinical findings demonstrate that ADC-induced ICD is amplified by AWT020, but not by anti-mPD-1, resulting in greater tumor regression and enhanced immunological memory. These results support the continued clinical development of AWT020 and to explore its potential in combination with ADCs, aiming to improve long-term survival and complete response rates in cancer patients.Citation Format:Fan Ye, Jianing Huang, Ella Li, Wen-Chin Huang, Fang Huang, Xiaoli Cheng, Jenny Jiang, Shih Chieh Chen, Botong Hua, Hanna Lin, Joyce Kwan, Eugene Liu, Ziyang Zhong.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are \"biological missiles\" that utilize a chemical linker to connect monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with cytotoxic drugs, which induces the precise killing of targeted tumor cells and causes the death of surrounding untargeted cancer cells through the bystander effect. However, current ADCs are too specific to certain cancer subtypes and not specific enough to accurately target a cancer-specific protein, which limits the therapeutic populations and induces unwanted side effects. We developed a heavy-chain antibody (HCAb) from a llama immune library, which recognizes glycosylated CEACAM6 (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6), a broad-surface marker of epithelial-type cancers. The anti-CEACAM6 HCAb showed a higher affinity (KD: sub-nanomolar), better thermal stability, unique tissue penetration and epitope-recognition abilities compared to the conventional antibodies. The anti-CEACAM6 HCAb-drug conjugate (HCAb-ADC), which links the HCAb and tubulin inhibitors via hydrophilic linkers, specifically killed CEACAM6-expressing colorectal (CRC), lung, pancreas, and bile duct carcinoma cells at sub-nanomolar concentrations and had a better anti-cancer effect than current FDA-approved ADCs. In xenograft models, a single administration of HCAb-ADC completely abolished colorectal and pancreatic tumors. Notably, HCAb-ADC can effectively inhibit tumor growth even at very low doses (0.2 mg/Kg) and demonstrated a superior therapeutic effect over current therapeutic regimens. Meanwhile, it exhibited minimal toxicity to normal epithelial and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In summary, the excellent anti-tumor activity across different epithelial cancers and minimal toxicity to normal tissues support the clinical development of the novel HCAb-ADC for treating multiple epithelial-type cancers, including CRC, lung, pancreatic, and bile duct carcinoma.Citation Format:Ming-Heng Wu, Yao-Tsung Tsai, Chee Voon Yap.

    "abstract": "IKSUDA Therapeutics\u2019 proprietary PermaLink\u00ae platform comprises simple, stable, and adaptable conjugation chemistry that overcomes the instabilities associated with the retro-Michael exchange of traditional maleimide-based chemistry. This platform enables ADC generation with a range of drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR) and can be applied to multiple payloads and linker chemistries to improve conjugate properties and maximize the therapeutic index of ADC therapeutics.ADCs are generated by reducing the hinge region disulfides and/or decapping engineered cysteines with TCEP, conjugation with PL-payload followed by purification. DAR was measured by HPLC. The stability of PL-based ADCs was compared to traditional maleimide-based ADCs in murine and human plasma. In vitro activity and bystander effect were assessed using mono or co-culture experiments by CellTiter-Glo assay. In vivo efficacy studies were conducted in SCID mice with human cancer xenografts. Toxicology and PK studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys.PL-based conjugation followed a simple process of reducing the antibody disulfides with TCEP, conjugation with PL-payload and removal of excess linker toxin by size exclusion chromatography, desalting or filtration. Control of process parameters such as TCEP and linker-payload excesses yielded conjugates with DARs ranging from 4-8 for native wildtype antibodies. Additionally, DAR 10 was achieved for an antibody with two engineered cysteines. The resulting ADCs demonstrated favorable biophysical properties with minimal aggregation by SEC and DAR assessment was consistent by PLRP-HPLC and MS. Typical yields at the research scale ranged from 70-90%.For preclinical proof-of-concept, MMAE conjugates of Isumab01, targeting FRA, were prepared with a protease-cleavable valine-citrulline (vc) and enzymatically cleavable \u03b2-glucuronide (glu) linker. Both PL-based conjugates showed excellent stability in murine and human plasma, whereas FDA-approved maleimide-based ADCs brentuximab vedotin and trastuzumab deruxtecan displayed a significant decrease in DAR. PL-MMAE conjugates were highly potent against JEG-3 cancer cells in vitro, with IC50 values in the pM range. Isumab01-PL-glu-MMAE resulted in complete tumor regression in a JEG-3 xenograft model following a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg and was very well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys at 12 mg/kg single dose and 10 mg/kg Q3W x2 (highest doses tested), showing improved tolerability over MMAE-based ADCs with maleimide-cathepsin B cleavable linkers. The Isumab01-PL-glu-MMAE conjugate demonstrates a favorable PK profile in monkeys with high stability in circulation consistent with improved bioconjugation.PermaLink offers a simple, stable alternative to maleimide-based ADC bioconjugation moieties and confers a favorable preclinical anti-tumor activity and safety profileCitation Format:Adam Lodge, Justyna Mysliwy, Will A.

    "abstract": "IKS04 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) targeting human CA242, also known as CanAg, a tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen. This glycotope is highly expressed in most colorectal, pancreatic, gallbladder, and gastric cancers, with limited expression in normal tissues. While prior experience demonstrated that CA242 can be safely targeted with an ADC, the limited clinical efficacy observed with microtubule inhibitor payloads in gastrointestinal indications suggests that alternate payloads such as DNA crosslinkers could provide an improved therapeutic to target CA242+ tumors more effectively.The ADC was generated by site-specific bioconjugation of a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) prodrug payload to the antibody light chain at a drug-to-antibody ratio of 2. The linker-prodrug incorporates two glucuronide-trigger moieties that require lysosomal cleavage by beta-glucuronidase to both release and activate the PBD dimer payload. In vitro antiproliferative and bystander activity was evaluated by CellTiterGlo assay. In vivo efficacy studies for ADC alone and antibody co-administration were performed with subcutaneous human xenografts in CB17-SCID mice. CA242 expression was determined in formalin fixed tumor samples by immunohistochemistry and on cell lines by quantitative flow cytometry.In vitro, IKS04 results in potent and specific cell killing of panel of CA242+ target cells and potency correlated with antigen expression determined by flow cytometry. The PBD payload confers strong bystander activity in co-culture studies in vitro, an attribute that may allow treating tumors with heterogeneous antigen expression. The ADC was active against gastric and colorectal cancer xenograft models at single doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg, while the maytansinoid-based ADC benchmark cantuzumab ravtansine was inactive even at 2 mg/kg. Contrary to in vitro results, we observed a trend towards greater in vivo activity in models with lower antigen expression. This is suggestive of an antigen barrier effect where high target expression results in ADC accumulation at the tumor surface, precluding deeper penetration into tumor tissue. As the maximum tolerated ADC dose can be limited by target-independent payload toxicities, we increased the overall in vivo dose by addition of antibody to improve delivery. Consistent with this concept, co-administration of the unconjugated antibody with the ADC at a 5 to 50-fold excess improved the minimally effective dose in the CA242-high SNU16 gastric and HT29 colon cancer models compared to ADC alone while the antibody itself had no anti-tumor activity.IKS04 is an ADC with a DNA crosslinker payload that shows potent in vitro and in vivo efficacy against gastric and colorectal cancer tumor models. Co-administration of the unconjugated antibody can improve ADC delivery which drives increased efficacy in preclinical models without increasing toxicity.Citation Format:Jutta Deckert, Justyna Mysliwy, Adam Lodge, James Stephenson, Sarah Robinson, Robert J.

    "abstract": "Background:About half of the currently FDA-approved antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are based on microtubule inhibitors, making them effective only against actively dividing cells. Non-dividing tumor stem cells in contrast cannot be eradicated and may cause resistance and tumor relapse. Hence, there is a high demand for novel payloads with unique modes of action to overcome the current limitations. Inhibition of NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage biosynthetic pathway of NAD+ starting from nicotinamide, induces cell death due to energy shortage in both dividing and non-dividing cell populations. Herein, we present encouraging in vitro and in vivo results of ADCs based on in silico designed NAMPT inhibitors (NAMPTi) as payloads, highlighting the potential of NAMPT inhibition as an emerging mode of action in ADC technology.Materials and methods:In Silico modelling:PDB published co-crystals of NAMPT with NAMPTi were used for database generation, compound enumeration, virtual screening and lead optimization of candidates in a multistep process using Schr\u00f6dinger Suite. In vitro viability cell lines: L540 (CD30+); MDA-MB-453 (HER2+)ADC:The cysteine-reactive NAMPTi linker-payload constructs were synthesized at Heidelberg Pharma and conjugated to both interchain and engineered cysteine residues of anti-CD30 or anti-HER2 antibodies yielding ADCs with an average DAR of 10.Animal models:The anti-tumor efficacy of NAMPTi-based ADCs was evaluated in female NXG mice intravenously inoculated with L540 tumor cells, and female NMRI-nu mice inoculated subcutaneously with NCI-N87 tumor cells. Animals were treated with single or multiple doses of anti-CD30 and anti-HER2 ADCs, respectively.Results:Computational models allowed the discovery of unexploited features within NAMPT catalytic pocket with the potential to be used for a new generation of NAMPTi. This new generation of NAMPTi was accessed through a new in silico campaign leading to NAMPTi optimized for the use as ADC payloads, translating in excellent in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy. Single and multiple dose treatment resulted in complete remission of NCI-N87 tumors and survival of L540 disseminated tumor-bearing animals was significantly prolonged upon treatment.Conclusions:Targeted drug delivery to CD30+ and HER2+ cell lines was achieved using ADCs with in silico optimized NAMPTi linker-payloads. The use of computational approaches in the optimization of NAMPTi enabled to address unexploited features of the catalytic pocket resulting in more potent, selective and stable inhibitors, which were optimized for the targeted delivery by ADC technology. The use of anti-CD30 and HER2 ADCs loaded with NAMPTi in the therapy of CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma and HER2+ breast cancer models, highlights this new modality as a promising approach in cancer therapy.Citation Format:Pablo Ruedas Batuecas, Hendrik Gruss, Sarah Jane Neuberth, Alexander Hempelmann, Anik\u00f3 P\u00e1lfi, Marija Vranic, Andreas Pahl, Torsten Hechler.

    "abstract": "Objective:Soft tissue sarcoma is a heterogeneous group of rare malignant tumors with a high unmet medical need. We evaluated the efficacy of two novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), ADCE-017 and ADCE-202, each consisting of three components: (1) an antibody targeting urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein (uPARAP), a collagen receptor highly expressed on mesenchymal tumor cells, (2) a linker, (3) and deruxtecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. The efficacy of ADCE-017 and ADCE-202 was assessed in 4 in vivo experiments using three different patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with high uPARAP expression.Methods:A total of 164 NMRI nu/nu mice were transplanted with PDX models of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (models UZLX-STS5, -STS200) or myxofibrosarcoma (-STS45). Mice were randomized for the following treatments: (1) vehicle control, (2) doxorubicin, (3) targeted antibody (\u201cnaked\u201d antibody without payload), (4) ADC-isotype control (deruxtecan linked to a non-specific antibody), (5) uPARAP-targeted ADC. Treatments were given as tail vein injection on days 1, 8 and 15. Tumor volume, bodyweight and general well-being of animals were monitored until day 100 or until reaching the humane endpoint. Statistical analysis was performed with Wilcoxon test and Mann-Whitney U-test, with p< 0.05 defined as statistically significant.Results:Treatment with ADCE-017 and ADCE-202 resulted in significant tumor growth delay in two experiments with STS200, compared to vehicle control and doxorubicin, and tumor volume shrinkage compared to baseline (day 1). Similar results were obtained with STS45, however, in this experiment the ADC-isotype control showed superior tumor volume shrinkage compared to ADCE-017. In STS5, tumor growth delay was observed with ADCE-017 as compared to the vehicle control and ADC-isotype control, with effects being similar to doxorubicin. Based on bodyweight assessment and necropsy of the mice, no severe toxicity was observed.Conclusion:In general, the novel uPARAP-targeted ADCs ADCE-017 and ADCE-202 showed superior anti-tumor effect in all three soft tissue sarcoma models as compared to vehicle control without any treatment-related side effects. These results warrant further preclinical studies in other types of sarcoma and a clinical evaluation of the ADCs as a potential new treatment option for soft tissue sarcoma.Citation Format:Chao-Chi Wang, Agnieszka Wozniak, Luna De Sutter, Lore De Cock, Karo Wyns, Ulla Vanleeuw, Sander Van Putten, Carmel Lynch, Patrick Sch\u00f6ffski.

    "abstract": "Background:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) target cytotoxic payloads like microtubule and topoisomerase I inhibitors to the tumor, thereby inducing selective tumor cell death. ADCs can also trigger anti-tumoral immune responses via induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). Recent advances in treatment of urothelial cancer demonstrate the high potential of ADCs, e.g. also in combination with PD-(L)1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, significant challenges still remain such as (partial) non-response, high relapse rates and notable toxicity, all highlighting the need to further improve the treatment. GDF-15 acts as a local immunosuppressant, disrupting immune cell infiltration and inhibiting myeloid cell differentiation. GDF-15 blockade in anti-PD1/PD-L1 relapsed/refractory, last-line cancer patients has shown durable anti-tumor responses when combined with PD-1 ICI (NCT04725474). Beyond tumoral overexpression, GDF-15 is also induced by various chemotherapeutic agents. Whether GDF-15 is induced by ADC payloads and could mediate resistance to therapy is currently unknown. Here, we investigated if ADC treatment can induce GDF-15 release from tumor cells and if GDF-15 neutralization may enhance ADC activity.Methods:Human tumor cell lines were treated with ADCs or unconjugated payloads. Cell viability, induction of ICD, and GDF-15 levels were measured in vitro by quantifying intracellular ATP, ecto-Calreticulin (ecto-CRT), and release of HMGB1, extracellular ATP (eATP), and GDF-15 in cell culture supernatants, respectively. Induction of tumoral and serum GDF-15 levels by ADCs was assessed in vivo using xenograft tumor models. The effect of GDF-15 neutralization on the anti-tumoral activity of ADCs was evaluated in syngeneic tumor models by monitoring tumor growth and animal survival.Results:ADCs and unconjugated payloads (MMAE, SN-38, calicheamicin, and PBD dimers) induced concentration-dependent lysis of tumor cells, releasing eATP and HMGB1 and translocating ecto-CRT, indicative of ICD induction. Concomitant with cell death, ADCs and their payloads induced GDF-15 release from tumor cells in vitro. ADC-induced GDF-15 release was confirmed in vivo by increase in tumoral and circulating GDF-15 levels in human tumor xenografted mice. Lastly, combining anti-GDF-15 with ADC treatment improved tumor growth delay markedly in a syngeneic tumor model, accompanied by enhanced immune cell infiltration and activation.Conclusion:ADC treatment induces GDF-15 which contributes to reduction of ADC activity. Blockade of GDF-15 enhances ADC activity and immune cell number and activation in the tumor. Therefore, GDF-15 blockade may hold significant potential as therapeutic strategy to enhance ADC activity in cancer patients.Citation Format:Neha Vashist, Daniel Sch\u00e4tzlein, Amelie K\u00f6hler, Sabrina Genssler, Jos\u00e9 Medina-Echeverz, Eugen Leo, Thorsten Ross, Christine Schuberth-Wagner.

    "abstract": "Background:Ovarian cancer (OC) remains a formidable challenge due to limited treatment options and inevitable development of multidrug resistance. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality, particularly for cancers with high unmet needs such as ovarian cancer (OC). MUC16, also known as CA125, is a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein overexpressed in ovarian cancer, serving as a biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring while contributing to tumor progression and immune evasion. Our laboratory previously identified 4H11, an antibody that preferentially binds to the retained (ectodomain) portion of MUC16. To exploit this target, we have systematically evaluated a panel of ADC payloads and linkers, including Auristatins (MMAE, MMAF), Camptothecin (SN-38), Maytansinoids, Calicheamicin, Nemorubicin, and Belotecan, conjugated to our proprietary antibody 4H11. Given the heterogeneity of OC, we investigated the efficacy of these ADCs across various subtypes, including high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and patient derived organoids.Methods:ADCs were synthesized by conjugating 4H11 to different payloads via established linker chemistries. The resulting ADCs were characterized for drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and stability. In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed using a panel of OC cell lines and patient-derived organoids representing multiple subtypes. Dose-response curves were generated to evaluate IC50 values, and selectivity for antigen-positive cells was confirmed. Additionally, we analyzed differential sensitivity among subtypes to identify the most effective payload and ADC formulation.Results:All ADCs demonstrated high stability and target specificity in vitro. Notably, ADCs with maytansinoids exhibited superior potency across HGSOC and other subtypes, achieving sub-nanomolar IC50 values in MUC16-positive cell lines. However, nemorubicin-conjugated ADCs showed enhanced efficacy in certain non-HGSOC subtypes, suggesting subtype-specific vulnerability. In organoid models, ADC efficacy closely mirrored cell line data, highlighting the translational potential of these findings. Importantly, payload and linker selection significantly impacted ADC performance, with maytansinoids yielding the best overall therapeutic index across of broad spectrum of OC histologic subtypes.Conclusion:The retained portion of MUC16 is a viable target for ADC development. The maytansinoid conjugates emerged as leading candidates for further preclinical evaluation and potential clinical development based on their broad spectrum of activity against multiple histological subtypes. Our findings further underscore preferential susceptibility of different OC histologic subtypes to different ADC payloads.Citation Format:Mengyao Xu, Bo Rueda, David Spriggs, Yeku Oladapo.

    "abstract": "Introduction:A specific class of compounds featuring a 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) indoline-2 scaffold demonstrated potent antitumor activity against cancer cells with elevated TRPM4 expression or estrogen receptor positivity through the sustained activation of unfolded protein response. This mechanism is distinct from existing toxins. Generally, these compounds exhibit low toxicity to most healthy tissues, with gastrointestinal toxicity being the primary adverse effect. Notable examples of this class include ErSO and laxative oxyphenisatin acetate. This study aimed to optimize this scaffold for use as antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) payloads. By selecting antigens with low gastrointestinal expression, this strategy could potentially overcome ADC resistance or synergize with existing ADCs, leading to durable patient responses and improved survival outcomes.Methods:The cytotoxicity of lead toxin, HLX91-048, and its related ADCs were evaluated in immortalized cell lines and treatment-resistant patient-derived organoids (PDOs) using the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay. To create the HER2-targeting ADC, HLX91-048 was linked to a HER2 antibody via a cleavable GGFG linker, resulting in drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4 or 8 as needed. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze the binding and internalization of the ADCs. Bystander killing assays were performed on the HER2- MCF-7 cells using conditioned media from HER2+ BT474 cell cultures. In vivo efficacy was tested in the BT474 breast cancer model and the DS-8201-resistant NCI-N87R gastric cancer model. The tolerability of HLX91-048 and the ADC was compared in parallel to DXd and DS-8201 in rats.Results:HLX91-048 demonstrates >10-fold increase in cytotoxicity compared to ErSO, exhibiting sub-nanomolar to nanomolar IC50 values across various tumor cell types. When compared to DS-8201 analog the HLX91-048-based ADC showed enhanced cytotoxicity in multiple cell lines, stronger bystander killing, and greater stability in human and monkey plasma. As expected, the HLX91-048-based ADC significantly activates the UPR. The DAR4 HER2 ADC derived from HLX91-048 exhibited dose-dependent antitumor efficacy in both BT474 and NCI-N87 models, leading to substantial tumor regression at higher doses (10-12 mpk). Notably, 5 out of 8 PDOs from patients resistant to various standard treatments remained sensitive to the HLX91-048-based ADC, while showing reduced sensitivity to DS-8201. Lastly, in a pre-toxicology evaluation in rats, both the DS-8201 analog and the HLX91-048-based ADC were well-tolerated at a dose of 60 mpk once weekly for three weeks.Conclusion:We reported a first-in-class ADC linker-payload featuring a highly differentiated killing mechanism that demonstrated exceptional efficacy and safety in preclinical evaluations. Preliminary toxicology studies in non-human primates have been scheduled.Citation Format:Rui Liu, Yushi Chi, Yongqiang Shan, Chenqiang Jia, Yingying Zhang, Xiayan Zhang, Wentao Zhang, Xuemei Tian, Yifan Zhang, Fan Yang, Dongmei Han, Simon Hsu, Jiamin Su, Jijun Yuan, Wan-Jen Yang, Xiaoling Yuan, Zhiyu Ma, Chen Hu.

    "abstract": "Tissue factor (TF, F3, coagulation factor III, thromboplastin, or CD142) is a 47-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein. In normal tissues TF expression is limited to the perivascular compartment where it is the cell surface receptor for the serine protease factor VIIa (FVIIa). Functionally, the TF/FVIIa complex converts the inactive zymogen Factor X (FX) to FXa triggering initiation of the extrinsic coagulation protease cascade. TF is overexpressed in a wide range of solid tumors, including pancreatic, cervical, and colorectal cancer as well as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which in combination with efficient receptor internalization makes TF an ideal antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) target. The TF-ADC tisotumab-vedotin (Tivdak\u00ae) has been approved for treatment of cervical cancer but is associated with serious side effects including ocular toxicities, peripheral neuropathy, and bleeding.ADCE-T02 is a first-in-class Topoisomerase-1 inhibitor TF-ADC composed of a humanized anti-TF IgG1 monoclonal antibody (Ab-754), conjugated via a novel T1000 linker moiety to the Topoisomerase-1 inhibitor Exatecan payload at a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4.ADCE-T02 binds with high affinity to human recombinant TF protein and multiple TF positive cell lines. Binding of ADCE-T02 to TF on the cell surface triggers internalization, resulting in intracellular exatecan release and cancer cell death. In addition, ADCE-T02 induces potent bystander cytotoxicity in TF negative cancer cells when cocultured with TF positive cells in vitro. In contrast to tisotumab, Ab-754 does not inhibit FXa activation and demonstrates reduced effect in coagulation assays in vitro. ADCE-T02 induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity but not antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In vivo, ADCE-T02 shows strong anti-tumor activity in a wide range of solid tumor models including pancreatic cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, NSCLC and HNSCC and is well tolerated in non-human primate toxicology studies with no evidence of ocular toxicity, peripheral neuropathy, or bleeding.In summary, ADCE-T02 constitutes a novel first-in-class Topoisomerase-1 inhibitor ADC targeting TF with a potentially enhanced therapeutic and safety profile. A phase I clinical study of ADCE-T02 in patients with advanced solid tumors is currently ongoing (Clinical Trial ID NCT06597721).Citation Format:Thomas Tuxen Poulsen, Yue Zhang, Jianjian Zhang, Huiyan Shi, Shu-Hui Liu, Xun Meng, Mette Gillberg, Dominik Mumberg.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent groundbreaking advancement in the cancer treatment landscape. ADCs combine the specific binding capacity of a monoclonal antibody with a cytotoxic payload that can kill target and bystander cells. The antibody moiety of ADCs confers payloads with the ability to target cancer cells with minimal damage to healthy tissues.A key consideration in defining appropriate breast cancer treatment regimen is the expression level of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), targeted with the antibody Trastuzumab. Breast cancers are classified as high, low, or negative for HER-2, which dictates the therapeutic approach. Trastuzumab alone may not be an effective treatment because tumors can either be initially resistant or develop resistance over time. Around 70% of patients experience resistance within the first year of treatment. To overcome this, ADCs such as Trastuzumab-Emtansine (DM1) or Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan (Dxd) can be used at lower doses, reducing the risk of resistance and potentially enhancing treatment efficacy.Assessment of Trastuzumab ADCs in multiple murine breast cancer models can be costly, but in vitro evaluation of various cancer histotypes facilitates the selective identification of the best murine model. Having a robust screening tool is an important asset. To assess Trastuzumab ADCs, we screened five breast cancer cells (BT-474, Hs 578T, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, SK-BR-3) with varying levels of HER-2 expression. They were evaluated for binding efficiency, competitive inhibition, and cytotoxicity of ADCs. Additionally, the ability of the ADC to kill bystander cells (HER-2 low or negative cells) was assessed using two bystander assay methods.The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values for Trastuzumab and Trastuzumab-Dxd were measured on two cell lines. The HER-2 high cell line had a tenfold higher EC50 value. Competitive inhibition of Trastuzumab-ADC binding was tested with a PE labeled Trastuzumab on two cell lines. The Trastuzumab-ADC was able to outcompete Trastuzumab on HER-2 high cells but not on HER-2 low/negative cells. Proliferation assays on multiple cell lines were used to assess the ability of Trastuzumab-DM1 to inhibit cell growth in comparison to DM1 (payload alone) or Trastuzumab (antibody alone). Overall, Trastuzumab-DM1 was better able to inhibit growth of HER-2 positive cells compared to payload or antibody alone.Two ADC bystander assays were developed and tested. The first involved flow cytometry and the second a luciferase assay. In both assays, bystander cells were more effectively targeted only in the presence of HER-2 positive cells. The ability of ADCs to target bystander cells suggest that even in heterogenous HER-2 expressing tumors, these therapies may still be effective. Our cutting-edge approaches provide precise insights into the activity and efficacy of Trastuzumab ADCs.Citation Format:Michael Steffey, Stacey Roys, Anita J.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a revolutionary breakthrough in cancer treatment by precisely targeting tumor cells with high-potency payloads attached to specific antibodies. However, the efficacy and safety of ADCs largely depend on the design and optimization of their payloads. This study leverages the advanced MtoxinTm platform to develop a novel ADC payload, MF6, aiming to enhance the antitumor activity of ADCs through precise drug design.Methods:Supported by the MtoxinTm platform, we first modified camptothecin-based compounds by preparing a series of camptothecin analogs with different substituents at the core position. Through in vitro efficacy testing, we screened out a series of compounds with significant antitumor activity and further optimized their attached dipeptide linkers. Subsequently, we conjugated the optimized drug-linker conjugates with anti-Trop2 and anti-B7H3 monoclonal antibodies to form novel ADCs. To comprehensively evaluate the potential of these ADCs, we conducted multiple experiments in vitro and in vivo, including pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety, and antitumor activity studies.Results:The experimental results showed that MF6, as a free molecule, exhibited good drug-killing activity and maintained significant efficacy in multidrug-resistant models resistant to DXd. ADCs constructed using the clinically validated site-specific conjugation technology IDDC\u2122 and our novel payload MF6 demonstrated good uniformity and stability, and exhibited significant antitumor efficacy in multiple CDX models. Additionally, these ADCs showed good bystander killing activity, meaning they could kill nearby tumor cells, thereby further enhancing their antitumor effect. We also found that ADCs synthesized with MF6 had excellent serum and plasma stability and pharmacokinetic properties, providing strong support for their future clinical application.Conclusions:This study successfully developed a novel ADC payload MF6 based on the MtoxinTm platform and initially validated its antitumor activity and safety in multiple in vitro and in vivo models. These results provide a solid experimental foundation for the further development of MF6-based ADCs for the treatment of various cancers. In the future, we will continue to explore the potential of MF6 and anticipate that MF6-based ADCs will undergo further clinical validation and application, bringing more precise, effective, and safe treatment options to cancer patients.Citation Format:Xiaowei Cen, Hui Xu, Huikai Zhu, Hua Deng, Zhenzhen Wang, Junwei Xu, Xueying Li, Zhiheng Wu, Yiyan Zhang, Yuhang Chen, Xiaolin Chen, Li Chen, Wei Zhou, Hai Wu.

    "abstract": "Endoglin (CD105), a TGFb-RII co-factor, overexpressed in tumor microvasculature and endothelial-derived CAFs, has been extensively validated as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Endoglin-targeting ADCs have been developed in this work, using a human IgG1 antibody, OMTX003, conjugated to different microtubule inhibitors such as eribulin (OMTX603-3) or MMAE (OMTX103), with DAR values between 4 and 8. Target binding was maintained within subnanomolar values for each ADC, similar to the unconjugated antibody. Internalization was efficient, with 75% intracellular localization within 60 minutes, regardless of the conjugated payload. In vitro activity in Endoglin-expressing HT1080 cells was target- and concentration-dependent, with IC50 values of 6 and 95.5pM, respectively. ADCs were tested for their in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in a gastric cancer PDX murine model. Complete tumor regression was observed. No re-growth occurred up to 40 days after treatment end, showing the lack of resistance to treatment. ADCs were well tolerated with no weight loss. These encouraging results are postulating these anti-ENG ADCs for further development.Citation Format:Isabel Ega\u00f1a, Patricia Gonz\u00e1lez-Callejo, Alvaro Gonz\u00e1lez, Cristina Ferrer, Roland Kontermann, Oliver Seifer, Klaus Pfizenmaier, Myriam Fabre.

    "abstract": "Background:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of cancer therapeutics comprised of a linker-payload conjugated to a monoclonal antibody targeting a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), to enable the delivery of the cytotoxic payload to cancer cells. Presently, there is a need for improved in vitro models that better recapitulate in vivo tumor tissue complexity to aid in the screening and evaluation of novel ADCs during preclinical development. Specifically, we have developed in vitro 3D models from cancer cell lines yielding spheroids in a rapid, robust and uniform manner. Using these spheroid models, we have developed cell-based assays to functionally evaluate the cytotoxic activity of ADCs in vitro. For further comprehensive characterization of ADC activity in 3D cell line models, we utilized the nCounter\u00ae ADC Development Panel, a specialized gene expression tool for molecular characterization of biological function, with customizable gene content to address complex questions important for the success of ADCs throughout discovery, pre-clinical and clinical development.Methods:Spheroids were generated by seeding ovarian cancer cell lines into microtiter plates treated with ultra-low attachment coating, using automated liquid-handling robots, followed by incubation with ADCs under standard culturing conditions, prior to functional transcriptomic evaluation. The nCounter ADC Development Panel was analytically validated and included performance specification of accuracy, precision, analytical specificity, and RNA input range of the panel to directly profile 770 genes addressing essential biological questions relevant to ADC activity, including tumor targeting and antigen expression; ADC internalization; payload release; drug mechanisms of action; target cell death; immunogenic cell death; and mechanisms of resistance.Results:The combination of high-throughput spheroid assays and comprehensive transcriptomic analysis presented herein highlight an important and streamlined workflow to aid in the screening and selection of therapeutic cytotoxic ADC candidates for the treatment of solid tumors.Citation Format:Meghan Hogan, Andrea Hern\u00e1ndez Rojas, Araba Sagoe-Wagner, Jodi Wong, Sarah Church, Brigitte Lovell, Sergio Hernandez, Lakshmi Chandramohan, Anna Juncker-Jensen, Kirsteen Maclean.

    "abstract": "The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein (uPARAP, endo180, CD280) is a type-1 membrane protein which acts as an endocytic receptor for collagen. uPARAP binds and internalizes both intact and partially degraded collagens. uPARAP-bound collagen is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and routed to the lysosome for further degradation, while uPARAP is rapidly recycled to the cell surface. In healthy tissues, uPARAP is expressed in a restricted number of cell types, mostly mesenchymal cell types in tissues characterized by an active matrix turnover such as skin during wound healing and in bone. In contrast, high expression levels of uPARAP are found on malignant cells of various non-epithelial cancers, including soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and osteosarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme and mesothelioma. Recent publications on immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based expression analysis with tumor samples from more than 900 patients1, 2 demonstrate that uPARAP is widely expressed at high levels across most sarcoma subtypes. The efficient internalization of uPARAP combined with the highly prevalent expression in non-epithelial tumors makes it a very attractive antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) target for the treatment of sarcomas. ADCE-D01 is a first-in-class uPARAP-ADC composed of a humanized anti-uPARAP IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated via a GFGG tetra-peptide linker moiety to the Topoisomerase I inhibitor P-1021 payload3 at a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. ADCE-D01 binds with high affinity to human recombinant uPARAP protein and multiple uPARAP positive cell lines. Binding of ADCE-D01 to uPARAP on the cell surface triggers internalization, resulting in intracellular payload release, induction of DNA damage and cell death. In addition, ADCE-D01 induces potent bystander cytotoxicity in uPARAP negative cells. In vivo, ADCE-D01 shows strong anti-tumor efficacy in a range of mesenchymal solid tumor models including soft-tissue sarcoma and is well tolerated in non-human primate toxicology studies with no evidence of target-specific toxicity. In summary, ADCE-D01 constitutes a novel First-in-Class ADC targeting uPARAP with an excellent therapeutic as well as safety profile. A phase I/II clinical study of ADCE-D01 in patients with advanced STS is imminent. 1Barkholt et al., Cancer Res (2024), (6_Supplement): 6355; 2Evans et al., Mol Cancer Ther (2023); 3Lin et al., J Transl Med (2024)Citation Format:Jonathan H.

    "abstract": "Many ADC drugs in clinical trials are showing poor performance without providing sufficient dose due to dose-limiting toxicity, which is rooted from on-target toxicity related to payload itself. There are many efforts to increase the therapeutic index (TI) of ADC, but research on discovering novel payloads based on unique anticancer mechanisms of action is relatively limited. We have developed unique ADC platform technology by adopting multi-drug payloads concept, where we aim to achieve three different goals, (1) increasing MTD and lowering MED (2) showing cytotoxic activity in antigen low-expressed cell lines (3) overcoming resistance cell lines with better cytotoxic effects. This study began with the search for a drug combination that could maintain or increase efficacy of MMAE even with lower dose of MMAE. Drugs with various mechanisms of action were tested to select a combination that showed a high synergy effect with MMAE, and a cell cycle regulating drug was found to offer the most synergistic combination efficacy with MMAE. By conjugating a dual-payload with two-different mechanisms of action to HER2 antibody(trastuzumab), the resulting ADC(CTPH-02) was confirmed to show synergistic effect in terms of cytotoxicity. Very excitingly, CTPH-02 shows significantly high synergistic efficacy in the case of cell lines with low HER2 antigen expression. These findings based on the right combination of two-different payloads open a new paradigm for ADC drug design strategies in cancer therapy in order to provide treatment options to wider range of cancer patients such as low TPS % with low IHC score.Citation Format:Chang-Sun Lee, Myeong Joo Kim, Da hyun Kim, Soyeon Lim, Jiwoo Lee, Eunseok Choi, Wonbin Ha, Han ah Kim, Jaebeom Park, Seung Chan Kim.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an innovative class of targeted cancer therapeutics that combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxic effects of small-molecule drugs. The development of ADCs requires an integrated approach to identify targets, optimize payload delivery, and validate efficacy across ex vivo and in vivo preclinical models. Selecting the right pipeline supporting ADC development is essential. Cell lines often fail to express the specific target antigens leading to discarding or retaining the wrong targets causing clinical failure. For these reasons, ADC development needs clinically relevant models such as patient-derived xenograft (PDX) reflecting clinical trial populations. Champions Oncology has generated a comprehensive preclinical platform to support ADC development by integrating molecular profiling, multi-omics integration and histology data along with functional assays and patient-derived ex-vivo and in vivo models. Champions\u2019 PDX bank includes over 1500 models, extensively characterized at a molecular level, and highly reflective of the current clinical trial populations. The deep multi-omics characterization, which includes a proteomic dataset in addition to transcriptomics data, provides a unique advantage in model selection for ADC development. The platform identifies novel targets by analyzing and correlating gene and protein expression in PDX models and validating these findings in clinical tumor samples and normal tissue. This ensures that potential ADC targets exhibit limited overlap with known ADC targets and are differentially expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, thereby minimizing off-target toxicity. Following target identification, the platform includes steps enabling the discovery and development phase, leveraging Champions\u2019 cell-based assays, proprietary ex vivo TumorGraft3D organoid platform, and in vivo model. These models, derived from primary patient tumors, retain the molecular and histopathological characteristics of human cancers enabling a deeper understanding of target biology, ADC internalization, and downstream cytotoxic effects. These analyses are integrated into the workflow to inform ADC construct design, including optimizing antibody specificity, and payload potency. Here we show an example of how Champions Oncology\u2019s integrated preclinical ADC development pipeline offers a comprehensive approach for identifying and validating new targets during ADC optimization for therapeutic success. This platform accelerates ADC discovery while ensuring translational relevance, paving the way for next-generation cancer therapeutics.Citation Format:Stefano Cairo, Mara Gilardi, Marianna Zipeto, Michael Ritchie.

    "abstract": "Background:PA289, is a novel seco-CBI-based prodrug payload which appears to exert cell-killing activity through the alkylation of one or more cytosolic proteins (Tietze et al, 2010). PA289, is the lead linker-payload from our ProAlk payload technology platform and is designed with tumor-selective glucuronide triggers that attenuate the potency of the payload until uptake into target cancer cells and selective release in the lysosome. The glucuronide linker and PermaLink (PL) conjugation chemistry ensure ADC stability. The unique mechanism of action of PA289 compared to currently used chemotherapies and ADC payloads, led us to generate proof-of-concept data for this novel ADC payload.Methods:The free payload and ADCs were tested for cell-killing activity in vitro by CellTiter-Glo assay. The prodrug linker-payload PA289, was conjugated using PermaLink technology to generate ADCs with a drug to antibody ratio (DAR) of approximately 4. Stability was determined in mouse and human plasma and in vivo efficacy was performed with subcutaneous human tumor xenografts in nude mice. Bystander effect was analyzed in vitro and compared to ADCs composed of MMAE and MMAF payloads. An exploratory toxicology study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys.Results:The free payload showed highly potent in vitro activity against 248 cancer cell lines representing 15 solid cancer indications with IC50 values in the fM to pM range. Isumab01-PL-PA289, a model ADC targeting FRA, displayed excellent plasma stability and was highly potent against the JEG-3 cell line in vitro, with IC50 values in the pM range. A single administration of Isumab01-PL-PA289 in the FRA-positive JEG-3 xenograft model induced complete tumor regression by day 30 when dosed at 2.2 mg/kg, while the Isotype-PL-PA289 non-binding control resulted in weak tumor growth inhibition. Evaluation of bystander killing in vitro with a model ADC targeting CA242, Isumab04-PL-PA289, demonstrated stronger bystander cell-killing than benchmark ADCs containing MMAE and MMAF. A pilot toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys treated with Isumab04-PL-PA289 showed the ADC was well-tolerated with minimal to no test-article related findings at the highest dose tested (7 mg/kg single dose).Conclusions:ADCs comprised of PA289, a novel protein alkylator prodrug linker-payload, demonstrate 1) strong in vitro potency and bystander effect, 2) durable tumor regressions in xenograft models, and 3) excellent tolerability in monkeys. The free payload is highly active against a broad array of cancer cell lines representing a variety of solid tumors suggesting that PA289 is a promising candidate for the development of ADCs with a novel MOA for the treatment of solid tumors.Citation Format:Justyna H.

    "abstract": "Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a 750 amino acid, homodimeric type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed mainly in prostate tissues, but also at low levels in renal proximal tubules, the small intestine, and the brain. PSMA is known to have two enzymatic functions, firstly in the removal of glutamate from dietary folates in the small intestine, and secondly in hydrolysis of the peptidic neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate. In the oncology setting PSMA is a clinically validated target with its expression being upregulated in prostate cancer as well an association with progression and aggressiveness of the disease. Here, the generation and preclinical characterization of ADCT-241, a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting PSMA is described. ADCT-241 is composed of a fully human IgG1 antibody directed against PSMA (anti-PSMA mAb), to which the PL2202 payload, containing the topoisomerase I inhibitor exatecan, has been stochastically conjugated via a cleavable valine-alanine linker with a drug:Ab ratio of 4 (DAR 4). In vitro, anti-PSMA mAb showed good binding affinity for human PSMA and cross-reactivity to rat and cynomolgus monkey PSMA. In addition, ADCT-241 showed specific and potent killing of prostate cancer cell lines, including LNCaP and C4-2, in in vitro cytotoxicity assays when compared to a non-binding control DAR 4 ADC containing the PL2202 payload. ADCT-241 showed bystander activity in in vitro assays employing PSMA-positive prostate cancer cell lines and PSMA-negative PC-3 cells. In vivo, administration of a single intravenous (IV) dose of ADCT-241 was associated with potent anti-tumor activity in prostate cancer xenograft models. Finally, in toxicology studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, ADCT-241 was well tolerated at dose levels up to 150 and 75 mg/kg, respectively, following dosing on Day 1 and 22. Circulating serum total antibody, total ADC, and free exatecan concentrations were determined, and showed good in vivo stability for ADCT-241 and a half-life of \u223c8.5 days in cynomolgus monkeys. In summary, ADCT-241 is a novel, stable PSMA-targeting ADC that mediates potent and specific anti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft models and exhibits an excellent tolerability profile in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The data presented support future clinical development of ADCT-241 for the treatment of prostate cancer indications.Citation Format:Ben Leatherdale, Beccie Martin, Banusha Rajeenthira, Cecile Oblette, Lara Montolio, Abigail Kimpalu, Pedro L.

    "abstract": "Background:Overexpression of Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) has been linked to various malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, renal, urothelial and ovarian cancer as well as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, making it a promising therapeutic target. Expression on tumor cells, as well as throughout the tumor microenvironment, including expression on cancer associated fibroblasts, cancer endothelium and suppressive infiltrating immune cells sets it apart from most existing antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targets. Here, an IL1RAP-targeting ADC was developed, consisting of a monoclonal antibody conjugated via a linker to a potent cytotoxic payload, designed to selectively deliver the cytotoxic agent to IL1RAP-expressing cells. The ADC was tested in vitro and in vivo to evaluate its therapeutic potential.Methods:A library of IL1RAP-binding clones was screened for affinity, cell binding, cynomolgus cross-reactivity and internalization. The selected antibody was conjugated to a maytansinoid using a cleavable linker. In vitro cell killing was assessed using SK-MEL5 WT and SK-MEL5 IL1RAP KO cells. The anti-IL1RAP ADC was tested in vivo using the human subcutaneous SK-MEL5 melanoma or the human BxPC3-CAF model (BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells co-inoculated with pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts). Mice were treated with single (5mg/kg, SK-MEL5 and BxPC3-CAF) or multiple (3mg/kg or 10mg/kg in SK-MEL5; 5mg/kg or 10mg/kg in BxPC3-CAF) doses of the IL1RAP-targeting ADC to evaluate anti-tumor activity. A surrogate anti-mouse IL1RAP ADC was developed and used to assess toxicity in mice (C57Bl/6 1, 3, 5 or 10mg/kg antibody, Q1W x 2 doses; Balb/c 20mg/kg antibody, Q1W x 2 doses).Resultsand Conclusions: The selected clone showed low nanomolar affinity to human (KD 4.9nM) and cynomolgus (KD 5.4nM) IL1RAP, strong binding to IL1RAP-expressing cells (IC50 6.9nM) and robust internalization in IL1RAP-expressing cells. Conjugation to the payload did not compromise binding of the antibody to IL1RAP-expressing cells. In vitro, the IL1RAP-targeting ADC showed IL1RAP-dependent cell killing. Furthermore, the IL1RAP-targeting ADC demonstrated significant dose-dependent anti-tumor activity, with tumor regression observed in both in vivo models used. Both the anti-human IL1RAP ADC and the anti-mouse IL1RAP ADC were well tolerated in mice as indicated by kidney and liver histology, hematology assessment and body weight. These results suggest that ADCs targeting IL1RAP may have promising therapeutic potential and support clinical development for IL1RAP-targeting ADCs across a broad spectrum of cancers.Citation Format:Elin Jaensson Gyllenback, Camilla Rydberg Millrud, Olga Ab, David Liberg.

    "abstract": "Designing targeted therapies that selectively eliminate tumor cells while sparing healthy tissues is a major goal in oncology, where antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as promising tools. Traditional ADCs rely on specific antigens on tumor cell surfaces, limiting their applicability to cancers that overexpress them. This study introduces an innovative approach redefining ADC technology, bypassing the need for cell surface antigen recognition and utilizing a novel DNA-targeting mechanism. We present V66, a lupus-derived, cell-penetrating, anti-DNA antibody engineered to deliver Exatecan, a potent Topoisomerase I inhibitor, directly to tumors. V66 offers a breakthrough approach by recognizing and binding to extracellular DNA (ecDNA) within the tumor microenvironment, which accumulates due to high rates of cell turnover, death and necrosis, providing a unique target absent in normal tissues. Upon binding to ecDNA, V66 enters tumor cells via the Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter (ENT2), overexpressed in various cancers but minimal in healthy cells, broadening ADC applicability. Interestingly, V66 accumulates to a greater extent in DDR-deficient cell lines in vitro, with this difference disappearing when ecDNA is removed, suggesting that elevated levels of ecDNA enhance V66 penetration. Fluorescently labeled V66-Exatecan confirmed its selective accumulation in tumors in vivo, with minimal signal to healthy tissues, underscoring its specificity and low toxicity potential. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that V66-Exatecan localizes to the nucleus, where Exatecan inhibits Topo-I, activating the DNA Damage Repair pathway and triggering cell death. This approach demonstrated potent anticancer activity, with low nanomolar EC50 values across diverse cancer cell lines. Preclinical models, including cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), showed significant tumor regression and improved survival in hard-to-treat cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and medulloblastoma, without the systemic toxicity typical of Topo-I inhibitors. V66-Exatecan also showed enhanced efficacy in DDR-deficient cells, which are particularly vulnerable due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms. Remarkably, we observed a significant percentage of complete regression in treated DDR-deficient tumors. Extensive toxicology studies established a substantial safety margin, with toxicity observed only at extremely high doses. The dual-targeting mechanism, which leverages both ecDNA presence and ENT2-mediated entry, sets V66-Exatecan apart from conventional ADCs, offering a versatile and safe option across diverse tumor types. This study lays the groundwork for further clinical exploration, representing a significant step toward adaptable, effective cancer therapies.Citation Format:Zaira Ianniello, Elias Quijano, Huimei Lu, Denise Hegan, Venu Bommireddy, Dale L.

    "abstract": "Background:Conventional antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) face significant challenges in treating solid tumors due to heterogeneous antigen expression or low antigen levels, resulting in suboptimal targeting and reduced therapeutic efficacy. While increasing the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) could enhance efficacy, traditional high-DAR approaches often compromise pharmacokinetics due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size. To address these limitations, we engineered a novel platform technology: a compact, 20-nm antibody drug-loaded unimicelle (unimer-micelle) conjugate (ADUC) utilizing single-chain polymer nanoparticles. This platform achieves an unprecedented DAR of approximately 40 while maintaining favorable physicochemical properties. Using this platform, we developed K-679, which combines cetuximab with DM1-loaded unimicelles.Methods:Antigen-binding specificity and cellular internalization of K-679 were evaluated using surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy. In vitro cytotoxicity, in vivo anti-tumor activities, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution were investigated in multiple human cancer cell lines and xenograft models. The bystander killing effect was quantified using an in vivo imaging system in mice co-inoculated with EGFR-positive and luciferase-expressing EGFR-negative cells. The benchmark ADCs were prepared by conventional conjugation of cetuximab with DM1.Results:K-679 exhibited EGFR-binding affinity equivalent to that of unconjugated cetuximab, efficient cellular internalization, and triggered cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell-growth inhibition in EGFR-positive cells, even in chemotherapeutic drug-resistant lines. In vivo studies demonstrated superior tumor-targeted delivery compared to conventional antibodies, and efficient payload release in tumors with minimal DM1 levels in circulation. This resulted in potent anti-tumor effects across multiple EGFR-positive tumor xenograft models, while showing no activity in EGFR-negative models. These observations reveal that K-679 mediates its anti-tumor effects in an EGFR-dependent manner through DM1-mediated cytotoxicity. Notably, K-679 showed significant bystander killing of EGFR-negative cells within heterogeneous tumors and exhibited efficacy in EGFR-low tumor models in which benchmark ADCs proved ineffective. Comparative studies further highlighted that K-679 outperformed lower-DAR variants at equivalent payload doses.Conclusion:Our findings establish K-679 as a promising therapeutic candidate for heterogeneous EGFR-expressing solid tumors, characterized by a more potent anti-tumor effect through an exceptionally high DAR, enhanced drug accumulation into tumors and significant bystander effect.Citation Format:Hideo Yoshida, Kenichi Suzuki, Kahori Hosono, Nobuhiro Fujimaki, Masaki Tamiya, Madoka Shiraishi, Hideyuki Higashi, Masato Mori.

    "abstract": "Background:Despite significant advancements in cancer treatment, gastric cancer (GC) still has a high incidence and mortality rate. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging as viable treatment option for GC. We previously identified glypican-1 (GPC1) as a novel cancer antigen in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using quantitative protein expression profiling analysis focused on plasma membrane proteins, and recognized it as a potential target for ADCs.Glypican-1 (GPC1), a cell surface proteoglycan, has gained interest for its role in tumor growth and as a potential biomarker. This study evaluated the efficacy of an ADC comprising a humanized anti-GPC1 monoclonal antibody with monomethyl auristatin E (GPC1-ADC) to target GPC1 in GC.Methods:GPC1 expression was assessed in GC cell lines and tissues. The cytotoxic efficacy of GPC1-ADC and its mechanism of action were evaluated using comprehensive in vitro assays. Further, in vivo efficacy was assessed in xenograft mouse models, focusing on tumor growth inhibition and its performance against peritoneal dissemination.Results:In vitro, GPC1-ADC exhibited significant cytotoxicity against GPC1-positive cell lines by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Additionally, GPC1-ADC exhibited promising bystander-killing activity through cancer-associated fibroblasts, underscoring its potential to target the heterogeneous tumor cell microenvironment characteristics of GC. In vivo, GPC1-ADC significantly inhibited tumor growth, demonstrating a substantial therapeutic effect in a peritoneal dissemination model. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens from patients with GC revealed that 90.2% of differentiated types and 66.7% of poorly differentiated types exhibit high GPC1 expression. High GPC1 expression in tumor samples was significantly related to poorer clinical outcomes for progression-free and overall survival.Conclusions:GPC1-ADC exerts a direct antitumor effect on GPC1-positive GC cells. Additionally, GPC1-ADC can impact GPC1-negative cells via GPC1-positive stromal cells. This mechanism is likely owing to the characteristics of MMAE, which has a bystander effect as the payload of GPC1-ADC. Our results suggest that GPC1-ADC may be a potential therapeutic candidate for GPC1-positive GC.Citation Format:Yuji Suzuki, Satoshi Serada, Kota Kawabata, Tsuyoshi Takahashi, Yuichiro Doki, Tetsuji Naka.

    "abstract": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is a promising class of anti-cancer drugs that combines a monoclonal antibody with a small therapeutic agent for cell-specific delivery. With many ADCs in clinical trials and over 10 approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since the beginning of this century, it is a rapidly expanding field. However, many clinical studies have been discontinued or terminated because of challenges such as low efficacy or off-target toxicity.Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla\u00ae) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd, Enhertu\u00ae) are two ADCs approved for HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancers that share the same anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, but differ in their payload and linker chemistry. T-DM1 consists of trastuzumab and tubulin inhibitor emtansine (mertansine) connected by a non-cleavable linker, while T-DXd combines trastuzumab and topoisomerase I inhibitor deruxtecan with a cleavable linker. T-DXd is also approved for non-HER2+ breast cancers, which reflects that the ADCs have different effects on tumors even though they share the same antibody. Further insights into the cellular targeting of the two ADCs and their respective free payloads may help in better understanding important differences.T-DXd and T-DM1 were profiled on 108 cancer cell lines in cell viability assays. Additionally, the free payloads, trastuzumab and the small molecule HER2 inhibitor tucatinib were profiled as single agents on the same cell lines. The cell line panel represents a broad range of tumor types including seven HER2+ cell lines. All cell lines were incubated with a 9-point dose range of each drug, followed by intracellular ATP readout to determine the cell viability. Half-maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were used for bioinformatic analyses to identify response predictors or differentiators based on genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic status of the cell lines.Comparison of cell line responses between the ADCs and their free payloads showed a higher selectivity of the ADCs. Linking trastuzumab to deruxtecan or mertansine thus improves selectivity in vitro. Nonetheless, the ADCs targeted more cell lines than trastuzumab alone, showing that the ADCs also have non-antibody directed effects. Additionally, the HER2+ cell line SK-OV-3 showed striking resistance to T-DXd (IC50 > 10, 000 ng/mL), while T-DM1 effectively targeted this cell line (IC50 = 393 ng/mL). Although a significant Pearson correlation between ERBB2 (HER2) upregulation and sensitivity to T-DXd (r = -0.39) and T-DM1 (r = -0.63) was found, the results above show that HER2 status alone is not sufficient for response prediction of HER2-directed ADCs. Other sensitivity predictors were determined by bioinformatic analyses on resistant HER2+ and sensitive non-HER2+ cells. This study provides insights into sensitivity predictors and differentiators of the two HER2-directed ADCs and the small molecule HER2 inhibitor tucatinib.Citation Format:Daphne J.

    "abstract": "Background:Ras mutation has been identified as one of the major oncogenes in many cancers. Recent breakthroughs in regulating the activity of RAS proteins have led to the discovery of several clinical therapeutic molecules, such as Sotorasib and Adagrasib. However, for patients with RAS mutations, drugs with broader indications, higher potency, better tolerability, and longer efficacy are urgently needed. On the other hand, ADC, as a new precise and efficient drug delivery method, provides a potential solution to the above unmet needs. Here, we disclose a new class of ADCs whose payloads target RAS variant proteins and exhibit excellent antitumor effects and tolerability both in vitro and in vivo.Method:Both selective and pan-RAS inhibitors were conjugated to various antibodies via cleavable peptide linkers and ancillary groups to improve druggability. The primary biological activities of payloads and ADCs were examined in a series of cellular proliferation assays. The in vivo antitumor effects of the ADCs were evaluated on selected cell-derived xenograft (CDX) mice models, where body weight changes of the test animals were used to estimate the tolerability of the molecules. Both in vitro and in vivo PK properties of the ADCs were also studied.Results:The potent KRAS G12D selective inhibitor P1 or pan-RAS inhibitor P2 (KRAS-G12C, G12D, G12S, G12V, G13D, etc.) was successfully conjugated with antibodies such as anti-Her2, Trop2, Claudin18.2, etc., with a maximum DAR value of 8. By optimizing the linker and ancillary group, ADC-1 maintained the high potency of its payload P1 in the antigen-specific cancer cell line GP2D (IC50 for P1: 0.5 nM vs ADC-1: 0.4 nM). ADC-1 exhibited excellent anti-tumor effects in animal models. For example, in the GP2D CDX model, a single dose at 10 mpk intravenous injection, 104% TGI (tumor growth inhibition) was observed on day 21. In addition, there was no significant difference in the weight change of the test animals in the ADC treatment group compared with the vehicle group. In both mouse and human plasma, the release of payload P1 from ADC-1 was less than 2% for up to 72 hours. Considering the drug load of approximately 3%wt on ADC, no payload-related safety issues emerged in the study.Conclusion:ADC containing RAS inhibitor is a new approach to treat RAS mutant tumors. It has shown good selectivity and potency in both in vitro and in vivo studies on a variety of tumors. It exhibits good PK and physicochemical properties. It also shows an acceptable safety profile. It is a promising measure for treating patients with RAS mutations in the clinic.Citation Format:Boyu Zhong, Tony Zhang, Zuyong Deng, Guangming Chen, Chunlan Dong, Liangbao Lai, Erchang Shang.

    "abstract": "The GlycOBI\u00ae enabling technologies represent a novel approach for the development of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) to achieve site-specific glycan conjugation through the proprietary dual-action enzyme EndoSymeOBI\u00ae. This innovative technology is capable of attaining homogeneous ADC at specific drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) while maintaining antibody integrity and function. A key feature of the technology is its exclusive linker, which has a unique design to enhance payload stability and enable selective release in the tumor microenvironment, thereby potentially broadening the therapeutic index. The ADCs that use the GlycOBI\u00ae enabling technologies are shown to be highly homogeneous while achieving uniform DAR configurations. These next generation ADCs, combined with optimized and novel linker designs, exhibit superior pharmacokinetics, stability, and antitumor activity compared to conventional ADCs in various animal models. The technology supports mono-specific and multi-specific antibodies, expanding its versatility for various therapeutic modalities. The flexibility of DAR configurations and proprietary linker design further demonstrate the technologies\u2019 adaptability across diverse payload classes, including cytotoxic agents, immunomodulators, and degraders. In preclinical models, OBI-902 (TROP2 GlycOBI\u00ae DAR4 ADC) and OBI-904 (Nectin-4 GlycOBI\u00ae DAR8 ADC), both using Exatecan, a potent topoisomerase 1 inhibitor as the payload, have demonstrated promising antitumor activities. Notably, OBI-904, with its DAR8 format, exhibits superior activities in animal models, including in low antigen expressing tumor models, compared to approved and other benchmark Nectin-4 ADCs. Further, both ADCs maintained their stability and avoided antibody aggregation. Both candidates are targeted for IND submissions in 2025, representing an important milestone in advancing the GlycOBI\u00ae ADCs to the clinics. The integration of glycan engineering, EndoSymeOBI\u00ae, and a novel linker design establishes the GlycOBI\u00ae suite of technologies as a robust and adaptable solution to address the current ADC limitations. These advancements underscore its transformative potential in driving the next generation of therapeutics.Citation Format:Teng-Yi Huang, Ka-Shu Fung, Yu-Chao Huang, Chi-Sheng Shia, Chi-Huan Lu, Nan-Hsuan Wang, Ya-Chi Chen, Ming-Tain Lai.

    "abstract": "Background:Conventional antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) face significant challenges in treating solid tumors due to heterogeneous antigen expression or low antigen levels, resulting in suboptimal targeting and reduced therapeutic efficacy. While increasing the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) could enhance efficacy, traditional high-DAR approaches often compromise pharmacokinetics due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size. To address these limitations, we engineered a novel platform technology: a compact, 20-nm antibody drug-loaded unimicelle (unimer-micelle) conjugate (ADUC) utilizing single-chain polymer nanoparticles. This platform achieves an unprecedented DAR of approximately 40 while maintaining favorable physicochemical properties. Using this platform, we developed K-679, which combines cetuximab with DM1-loaded unimicelles.Methods:Antigen-binding specificity and cellular internalization of K-679 were evaluated using surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy. In vitro cytotoxicity, in vivo anti-tumor activities, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution were investigated in multiple human cancer cell lines and xenograft models. The bystander killing effect was quantified using an in vivo imaging system in mice co-inoculated with EGFR-positive and luciferase-expressing EGFR-negative cells. The benchmark ADCs were prepared by conventional conjugation of cetuximab with DM1.Results:K-679 exhibited EGFR-binding affinity equivalent to that of unconjugated cetuximab, efficient cellular internalization, and triggered cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell-growth inhibition in EGFR-positive cells, even in chemotherapeutic drug-resistant lines. In vivo studies demonstrated superior tumor-targeted delivery compared to conventional antibodies, and efficient payload release in tumors with minimal DM1 levels in circulation. This resulted in potent anti-tumor effects across multiple EGFR-positive tumor xenograft models, while showing no activity in EGFR-negative models. These observations reveal that K-679 mediates its anti-tumor effects in an EGFR-dependent manner through DM1-mediated cytotoxicity. Notably, K-679 showed significant bystander killing of EGFR-negative cells within heterogeneous tumors and exhibited efficacy in EGFR-low tumor models in which benchmark ADCs proved ineffective. Comparative studies further highlighted that K-679 outperformed lower-DAR variants at equivalent payload doses.Conclusion:Our findings establish K-679 as a promising therapeutic candidate for heterogeneous EGFR-expressing solid tumors, characterized by a more potent anti-tumor effect through an exceptionally high DAR, enhanced drug accumulation into tumors and significant bystander effect.Citation Format:Hideo Yoshida, Kenichi Suzuki, Kahori Hosono, Nobuhiro Fujimaki, Masaki Tamiya, Madoka Shiraishi, Hideyuki Higashi, Masato Mori.

    "abstract": "HER3 (Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3) is broadly expressed in several cancers, including breast, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, prostate, and bladder cancers. Elevated HER3 expression is associated with poor patient outcomes and therapeutic resistance. Several HER3-ADCs have been developed for cancer therapy. To date, patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402) is the only HER3-targeting therapy that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in both non-small cell lung cancer. But patritumab deruxtecan is ineffective in more challenging tumor type including low HER3 expression tumors.This study presents preclinical evaluation of a novel dual-payload HER3-targeting ADC, KHN922, composed of a humanised IgG1 antibody (patritumab) directed against HER3 which is conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (TopoIi) and an RNA polymerase II inhibitor (RNA POL IIi). KHN922 achieves an average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of about 7.5 (3.9+3.6) using cystein and glycosite antibody coupling technologies with an appropriate DAR, high SEC purity, homogeneous particle size distribution, and favorable thermal stability.The dual mechanism of KHN922 enables the simultaneous inhibition of RNA synthesis and the induction of DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in a potent and synergistic anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo xenograft mouse models in comparison to other TopoIi-TROP2-targeting ADCs. In low and ultra-low HER3 expression CDX models, the KHN922 demonstrated superior tumor suppression effects compared to single-TopoIi ADCs, patritumab deruxtecan and patritumab exatecan.Furthermore, KHN922 still showed strong activity to DXd-ADC treatment resistance CDX models. The non-GLP toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys provided evidence of the favorable safety profile of KHN922, the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) is 50 mg/kg/dose. In summary, KHN922, an ADC with dual toxins and unique mechanisms of action, displayed superior anti-tumor effects, the ability to overcome treatment-resistance and tumour recurrences, and an acceptable safety profile in preclinical studies. These findings support the potential of KHN922 as a promising advanced therapeutic candidate for HER3 tumors.Citation Format:Yonghao Zhao, Pengfei Ren, Menglong Guan, Jiao Tang, Lu Qi, Xinzou Fan, Shijun Yin, Gang Lei, Xiao Ke.

    "abstract": "Although ADCs have demonstrated great clinical promise, their therapeutic window remains limited due to the complexity of this drug format. Factors contributing to this narrow safety window include the instability of the linkers, accelerated plasma clearance due to the hydrophobicity of the ADCs, and off-target toxicity caused by nonspecific uptake by non-antigen expression healthy cells, free payload pre-release in the circulation system, low tumor retention due to heterogeneity of tumor antigen level and ADC DAR value By preserving the essential functions of the antibody and the payload, an optimized linker can significantly enhance ADC therapeutic window by increasing hydrophilicity and stability while reducing non-specific endocytosis by non-tumor cells. We have designed a panel of novel linkers focused on improving hydrophilicity and stability of ADC, with a particular emphasis on reducing its off-target endocytosis. A key feature of our linkers is the inclusion of a negative charged side chain and hydrophilic chaperone, which not only minimizes non-specific uptake by non-tumor cells but also greatly enhances its hydrophilicity. The side chain linker with this special architecture allows efficient enzymatic cleavage to ensure rapid payload release intracellularly, and lead to superior bystander cell killing effect than the ADC with GGFG-Dxd linker system. One example exploiting the proprietary linker is Trastuzumab-BL-001-exatecan with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8, demonstrated hydrophilicity comparable to Trastuzumab-GGFG-Dxd (biosimilar) in HIC analysis, with no aggregation detected by analytical SEC. This ADC exhibited excellent stability, maintaining high solubility, and cytotoxicity under stressed conditions. It also resisted deconjugation in the presence of high concentration of N -acetylcysteine and showed exceptional stability in human and mouse plasma. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats indicated favorable pharmacokinetic properties, while efficacy testing in the NCI-N87 tumor model revealed comparable performance to Trastuzumab-GGFG-Dxd. Additionally, BLB-101 ADC, featuring the same linker, was well tolerated in non-human primates following repeated administration. In conclusion, our novel linker designs offer significant advantages, with features that could expand the therapeutic window of current ADCs by improving their stability, reducing off-target effects, increasing bystander activity, and maintaining efficacy. We are also expanding the utility of this class of linkers to enable ubiquitous design of dual-payload-ADC Degrader-Antibody-Conjugates.Citation Format:David Yi, Wen Zhang, John Liu, Suk Lee, Alice Chen.

    "abstract": "Background:Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 IIIb (FGFR2b), one of the four FGFR family members that encode transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, such as gastric/GEJ (29%), esophageal (41%), squamous NSCLC (31%), TNBC (13%), ovarian (40%), endometrial (86%), cervical (80%), colorectal (62%), and cholangiocarcinoma (22%). We have developed a FGFR2b-targeting ADC (TST105) with a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by using glycotransferase mediated site-specific conjugation and characterized its in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in preclinical tumor models.Methods:A novel anti-FGFR2b humanized antibody 38D4 was generated by hybridoma platform. The binding affinity was analyzed by Fortebio Octet, and the selectivity and species cross-reactivity were assessed by ELISA. Antibody internalization was conducted by using Fluoresence Image. Cytotoxicity of TST105 was tested in tumor cell lines with different levels of FGFR2b expression. The bystander effect was assessed in co-culture experiments with the FGFR2b-negative and -positive tumor cells. Anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated in FGFR2b-positive tumor cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models in mice.Results:38D4 specifically binds to FGFR2b with a higher affinity than the Bemarituzumab-analog. 38D4 binds with comparable affinity to human, cynomolgus, rat and mouse FGFR2b. Significant internalization of 38D4 was observed after 4 hour and 24 hour-culture at 37\u00b0C. In the gastric (SNU-16) and colorectal (SW480-FGFR2b) tumor cell lines, TST105 demonstrated specific killing activity with a potency between 0.3 nM and 0.4 nM in vitro, which was weaker than both 38D4-MMAE and Bema-MMAE (stochastic conjugated). However, a higher potent bystander effect of TST105 than them was observed, indicating the potential to treat tumors with heterogeneous target expression. Furthermore, in SNU-16 xenograft model, which endogenously expresses FGFR2b at a high level, TST105 induced a better anti-tumor efficacy than Bema-MMAE. TST105 had a tumor growth inhibition of 91.25% and overall response rate (ORR, 50% reduction of tumor volume from baseline) of 70% at 3 mg/kg QW, while Bema-MMAE only reduced tumor growth of 48.32% with no ORR. The similar superior tumor regression efficacy of TST105 was also observed in colorectal tumor model SW480-FGFR2b. This differentiation may be contributed by the glycotransferase site-specific conjugation, which can eliminate Fc function, thus reduces the non-specific endocytosis in normal cells and leads to ADC enrichment in the FGFR2b-positive tumors.Conclusions:FGFR2b ADC TST105 demonstrated the high potency, strong anti-tumor activity and bystander effect in the preclinical studies, which support further investigations of TST105 in FGFR2b positive solid tumors.Citation Format:Fei Teng, Huanhuan Guo, Hongjun Li, Lizhi Qin, Xinlai Yao, Lei Shi, Yi Gu, Xueming Qian.

    "abstract": "Tissue factor (TF, F3, coagulation factor III, thromboplastin, or CD142) is a 47-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein. In normal tissues TF expression is limited to the perivascular compartment where it is the cell surface receptor for the serine protease factor VIIa (FVIIa). Functionally, the TF/FVIIa complex converts the inactive zymogen Factor X (FX) to FXa triggering initiation of the extrinsic coagulation protease cascade. TF is overexpressed in a wide range of solid tumors, including pancreatic, cervical, and colorectal cancer as well as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which in combination with efficient receptor internalization makes TF an ideal antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) target. The TF-ADC tisotumab-vedotin (Tivdak\u00ae) has been approved for treatment of cervical cancer but is associated with serious side effects including ocular toxicities, peripheral neuropathy, and bleeding.ADCE-T02 is a first-in-class Topoisomerase-1 inhibitor TF-ADC composed of a humanized anti-TF IgG1 monoclonal antibody (Ab-754), conjugated via a novel T1000 linker moiety to the Topoisomerase-1 inhibitor Exatecan payload at a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4.ADCE-T02 binds with high affinity to human recombinant TF protein and multiple TF positive cell lines. Binding of ADCE-T02 to TF on the cell surface triggers internalization, resulting in intracellular exatecan release and cancer cell death. In addition, ADCE-T02 induces potent bystander cytotoxicity in TF negative cancer cells when cocultured with TF positive cells in vitro. In contrast to tisotumab, Ab-754 does not inhibit FXa activation and demonstrates reduced effect in coagulation assays in vitro. ADCE-T02 induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity but not antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In vivo, ADCE-T02 shows strong anti-tumor activity in a wide range of solid tumor models including pancreatic cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, NSCLC and HNSCC and is well tolerated in non-human primate toxicology studies with no evidence of ocular toxicity, peripheral neuropathy, or bleeding.In summary, ADCE-T02 constitutes a novel first-in-class Topoisomerase-1 inhibitor ADC targeting TF with a potentially enhanced therapeutic and safety profile. A phase I clinical study of ADCE-T02 in patients with advanced solid tumors is currently ongoing (Clinical Trial ID NCT06597721).Citation Format:Thomas Tuxen Poulsen, Yue Zhang, Jianjian Zhang, Huiyan Shi, Shu-Hui Liu, Xun Meng, Mette Gillberg, Dominik Mumberg.

    "abstract": "The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor-associated protein (uPARAP, endo180, CD280) is a type-1 membrane protein which acts as an endocytic receptor for collagen. uPARAP binds and internalizes both intact and partially degraded collagens. uPARAP-bound collagen is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and routed to the lysosome for further degradation, while uPARAP is rapidly recycled to the cell surface. In healthy tissues, uPARAP is expressed in a restricted number of cell types, mostly mesenchymal cell types in tissues characterized by an active matrix turnover such as skin during wound healing and in bone. In contrast, high expression levels of uPARAP are found on malignant cells of various non-epithelial cancers, including soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and osteosarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme and mesothelioma. Recent publications on immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based expression analysis with tumor samples from more than 900 patients1, 2 demonstrate that uPARAP is widely expressed at high levels across most sarcoma subtypes. The efficient internalization of uPARAP combined with the highly prevalent expression in non-epithelial tumors makes it a very attractive antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) target for the treatment of sarcomas. ADCE-D01 is a first-in-class uPARAP-ADC composed of a humanized anti-uPARAP IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated via a GFGG tetra-peptide linker moiety to the Topoisomerase I inhibitor P-1021 payload3 at a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. ADCE-D01 binds with high affinity to human recombinant uPARAP protein and multiple uPARAP positive cell lines. Binding of ADCE-D01 to uPARAP on the cell surface triggers internalization, resulting in intracellular payload release, induction of DNA damage and cell death. In addition, ADCE-D01 induces potent bystander cytotoxicity in uPARAP negative cells. In vivo, ADCE-D01 shows strong anti-tumor efficacy in a range of mesenchymal solid tumor models including soft-tissue sarcoma and is well tolerated in non-human primate toxicology studies with no evidence of target-specific toxicity. In summary, ADCE-D01 constitutes a novel First-in-Class ADC targeting uPARAP with an excellent therapeutic as well as safety profile. A phase I/II clinical study of ADCE-D01 in patients with advanced STS is imminent. 1Barkholt et al., Cancer Res (2024), (6_Supplement): 6355; 2Evans et al., Mol Cancer Ther (2023); 3Lin et al., J Transl Med (2024)Citation Format:Jonathan H.

    "abstract": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) consist of an antibody conjugated to a chemotherapeutic drug. These therapeutic compounds are designed to exert improved targeted toxicity as compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, variable therapeutic outcome has been experienced and predictive markers for response are warranted. ADCs are dependent on endocytosis to exert their effect, and we have hypothesized that proteins regulating the endocytic machinery can be utilized as predictive biomarkers. We have shown, for the first time, that the expression level of Rab5A, a protein regulating endocytosis correlates to the efficacy of Trastuzumab Emtansine, a HER2 targeted ADC. Furthermore, we have documented Rab5A as a predictive biomarker for Trastuzumab emtansine in three independent clinical cohorts. We are currently investigating the interplay between different ADCs and the endo/lysosomal machinery, and aim to develop this concept to a diagnostic tool for patients to be treated with ADCs. We use Trastuzumab emtansine, Trastuzumab deruxtecan and Sacituzumab Govitecan as model ADCs and evaluate the impact of different Rab GTPases on their mechanism of actions in cell lines from breast- and lung-cancer.Citation Format:Anette Weyergang, Astrid Medhus, Kay Oliver Schink, Kristian Berg, Olav Engebraaten.

    "abstract": "Biologic agents, such as monoclonal antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), have emerged as a highly promising class of the cancer therapeutics due to their ability to target specific tumor antigens with high specificity, be engineered for selective delivery of cytotoxic payloads, and work through diverse mechanisms of action. While these complex characteristics render biologics highly effective in vivo, they pose difficulty for systematically evaluating these agents in vitro. Here, we describe a multiplexed screening approach to overcome these challenges using the PRISM assay, where antibodies and ADCs are screened across 900+ cancer cell lines. We first investigated a panel of HER2-targeting ADCs conjugated to several different linkers and payloads. We assessed target selectivity and observed a clear association between cell line sensitivity and HER2 expression, with the strongest effects on viability observed in a subset of cell lines overexpressing HER2. We further compared profiles across different ADC targets and payloads to investigate predictive biomarkers of payload sensitivity and characterize bystander killing capabilities. Finally, we developed an antibody internalization reporter (AIR) assay to enable screening of unconjugated monoclonal antibodies. We optimized the AIR methodology using a secondary Fab-drug conjugate which can be used to load drug payload onto any IgG antibody to target and kill cells that are recognized by the primary antibody. To validate this approach, we screened trastuzumab in combination with a secondary Fab conjugated to MMAF via a non-cleavable linker. Comparative profiling with trastuzumab directly conjugated to the same payload revealed similar cytotoxic potency and target selectivity. These results demonstrate how the PRISM AIR method can enable screening of antibody candidates for ADC development to evaluate antigen-specific binding, internalization and cell killing potential. Overall, our study highlights the capabilities of the PRISM assay for investigating antibodies and ADCs.Citation Format:Jillian N.

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been considered the first line of antitumor therapies for patients with advanced or metastatic cancer, however these therapies demonstrate numerous drawbacks and acquired resistance is still inevitable in most cases. In order to address these challenges, scientists have discovered a novel class of cancer-targeted drugs referred to as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADCs are an emerging class of therapies that conjugate monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic payloads through a chemical linker, allowing precise delivery of drugs to cancer cells. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an ADC composed of a humanized IgG antibody that specifically targets HER2, a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. T-DXd is the second HER2-targeting ADC approved by the FDA after trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1); approved for HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer in the second line and as an adjuvant therapy for residual disease in breast cancer patients with early stage disease. Both ADCs have demonstrated promising clinical efficacy in the treatment of HER2-positive solid cancers, which has sparked great interest in the development of the next generation of ADCs. Emerging evidence indicates that the efficacy of a given ADC depends on a number of key factors including the fine tuning between the combination of the antibody, linker and payload components, how the ADC is processed and it\u2019s interaction with the cancer cells. Here we present robust and reproducible data from our comprehensive modular in vitro and in vivo screening platform, that has been developed to facilitate efficient and streamlined approaches for ADC screening and characterization, and have been validated using T-DXd and T-DM1 as proof-of-concept agents. Our platform offers assays that can evaluate ADC binding, internalization, anti-proliferative activity, ADC effects on cell cycle, apoptosis, and bystander effects. Immunological assays, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) can be employed to assess the induction of Fc effector functions. Additionally, we have validated a number of in vivo models including co-inoculation and intracranial xenograft models. Our data demonstrates that both ADCs exhibit strong binding and internalization, with T-DXd showing a pronounced bystander effect due to its payload release via a cleavable linker. Both agents effectively induced ADCC and ADCP, with minimal complement-dependent cytotoxicity observed. The T-DXd bystander effect was also confirmed used an in vivo co-inoculation xenograft model and efficacy of both T-DXd and T-DM1 against a human intracranial xenograft model was confirmed. This platform provides a comprehensive and customizable tool for ADC preclinical assessment, supporting the optimization of ADC therapeutic efficacy and safety.Citation Format:Zichun Wang, Qiong Wang, Shuyue Wang, Guilan Wang, Qikuan Chen, Wei Xue, Yinfei Yin.

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, genomic alterations have become important biomarkers for predicting response to targeted therapies; however, the emergence of immunotherapy, antibody-drug conjugates and multispecifics may require a different class of biomarkers that can quantify and localize drug targets within tumor and immune cells. Genomic testing frequently lacks correlation with protein expression, fails to capture membranous versus cytoplasmic localization, and has limited ability to decipher spatial interactions between targets. Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) is an established technology capable of quantifying and capturing the subcellular localization of dozens of proteins (>25 proteins per slide), enabling parallel assessment of a large number of drug targets. Here we describe a framework for leveraging high-plex spatial proteomics with an AI-driven platform to develop rational approaches for evaluating individual targets and combinations of targets within and across disease indications. We designed a 30-plex mIF panel to perform sequential immunofluorescence (seqIF\u2122) on the COMET\u2122 platform to profile known tumor antigens and targets (n = 18) currently in development along with the tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cells, and key signaling cascades (n = 12). We tested this panel on 217 samples (>1, 700, 000 cells) from lung (n = 90), gastric (n = 11), and colorectal (n = 68) cancers, as well as normal tissue specimens (n = 48, 22 sites). Utilizing Nucleai\u2019s deep-learning-based multiplex imaging analysis pipeline, we quantified the protein abundance, localization, and interactions among 9 different cell types. Tissue areas were divided into subregions and neighborhoods to characterize localization of these cell types to distinct areas including the tumor core (TC), tumor invasive margin interface (TIM), and stroma. We confirmed known drug targets with historical approvals in each of these indications, which validated that the pipeline was able to correctly identify key targets based on subcellular localization, spatial proximity analysis, and analysis of off-target cell type expression. We also identified potential combination partners for multi-specifics based on target colocalization, which were found to have reductions in off-target cell colocalization, as determined by protein expression in the right compartment and in the expected cell types. Nucleai\u2019s platform enables deep spatial proteomic profiling by deriving AI-driven insights for actionable characterization of protein interactions and patient heterogeneity across tissues. We demonstrate that this framework can aid in the prioritization and derisking of potential drug targets used by key classes of therapeutics currently in development.Citation Format:Michael Mints, Ettai Markovits, Ron Elran, Shai Bookstein, Yuval Shachaf, Elad Amsalem, Mor Kenigsbuch, Jason W.

    "abstract": "Background-Hormone Receptor-Positive/HER2-low (HR+/HER2-low) and Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) represent distinct subtypes of breast cancer with varying treatment approaches and clinical outcomes. Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-Dxd) and Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG), the two ADCs, have emerged as promising therapeutic options for both subtypes. However, there is a lack of real-world data comparing the effectiveness of these agents in different treatment sequences. This retrospective study aims to compare the sequencing of T-Dxd and SG in HR+/ HER2-low and TNBC patients at Henry Ford Cancer Institute(HFCI), with a primary focus on median progression-free survival (mPFS).Methods-The electronic medical records of patients at HFCI from January 2020 to August 2024 were searched to identify patients diagnosed with metastatic HR+/HER2-low and TNBC who had received both SG and T-Dxd. Patients with incomplete medical records were excluded. Based on the tumor type and sequencing of treatment, patients were divided into four groups: 1) HR+/HER2-low who received T-Dxd followed by SG, 2) HR+/HER2-low who received SG followed by T-Dxd, 3) TNBC who received SG followed by T-Dxd, and 4) TNBC who received T-Dxd followed by SG. The mPFS, median overall survival (mOS), overall response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) for each of these four groups were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier Method.Results-A total of 33 patients were initially identified. Of these, 14 patients were HR+/HER2 low (median OS = 18 months, 95% CI 13.737 - 22.263), 14 were TNBC (median OS was 17 months, 95% CI 12.16 - 21.84), and 5 were excluded. Amongst Group 1 patients (n=12), mPFS after receiving T-Dxd was 7.09 months, mOS was 18.07 months, ORR was 33%, and DCR was 75%. On progression, they received SG with mPFS of 3.08 months, mOS of 5.61 months, and DCR of 40%. Amongst Group 2 patients (n=2), mPFS after receiving SG was 1.15 months, and mPFS after receiving sequential T-Dxd was 2.07 months. Amongst Group 3 patients (n=11), the mPFS after receiving SG was 5.06 months, mOS was 15.08 months, ORR was 22.2%, and DCR was 66.7%. Those who progressed and received T-Dxd had an mPFS of 2.16 months, an mOS of 6.3 months, and a DCR of 22.2%. Amongst Group 4 patients (n=3), mPFS after receiving T-Dxd was 7.95 months, mOS was 17.97 months, ORR was 33.3% and DCR was 100%. Those who progressed and received SG had mPFS of 3.08 months, mOS of 5.61 months, and DCR of 40%.Conclusion-Our retrospective study presents real-world data on the effect of sequencing the ADCs. The overall benefit observed is lesser when a second ADC is used after the first ADC. Contrary to common practice, using T-Dxd followed by SG sequencing, regardless of receptor status, appears more effective in our patient population than the reverse. Further studies analyzing the sequencing of ADCs prospectively with larger cohort populations and identifying biomarkers to aid patient selection can be conducted.Citation Format:Dhairya Gor, Maria Jamil, Sunita Ghosh, Vrushali Dabak.

    "abstract": "Background:Nadunolimab, a fully humanized ADCC-enhanced, monoclonal IgG1 antibody targets IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) and blocks IL-1 signaling. In pts, nadunolimab with standard chemotherapies showed good safety and promising efficacy. In 73 advanced pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC) pts, combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine showed 33% ORR and 13.2mo OS, with 48% ORR and 14.2mo OS in the IL1RAP-high subgroup. In 40 1st or 2nd line non-small cell lung cancer pts, combination with platinum-doublet showed 55% ORR and 13.7mo OS, with 91% ORR and 26.7mo OS in the 2nd line non-squamous subgroup. Interestingly, in addition to promising anti-tumor effects, a significantly delayed onset and reduced incidence of nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine-related chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) were observed in pts receiving higher doses of nadunolimab compared to lower doses (36% vs 60%). CIPN is a neuroinflammatory side effect driven by immune activation and cytokine release such as IL-1 that limits treatment and severely impairs quality of life. Building on these promising findings, our aim was to further investigate nadunolimab\u2019s additional potential in mitigating neuropathies associated with chemotherapy and ADCs.Methods:The potential neuroprotective effect of nadunolimab was analyzed in two clinical trials: one involving 14 pts with 8 different cancer indications treated with FOLFOX and nadunolimab at 1 mg/kg (n=7) or 0.5 mg/kg (n=7), and another involving 18 PDAC pts treated with FOLFIRINOX and nadunolimab at doses of 0.5 mg/kg (n=8), 1 mg/kg (n=3), 1.5 mg/kg (n=4), and 2.5 mg/kg (n=3). In mice, neuropathy was induced by vincristine, nab-paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, or ADC payloads. The effects of nadunolimab surrogate antibody (10 mg/kg) on neuropathy were evaluated using electronic von Frey apparatus, parallel rod floor apparatus, and grip strength meter. Tissue samples were analyzed for inflammatory markers and immune cell infiltration.Results:We observed a lower incidence of any-grade FOLFOX-induced CIPN in the 1 mg/kg nadunolimab dose group compared to the 0.5 mg/kg dose group (43% vs 100%) and a significantly longer time to onset (median not estimable vs 4 days; HR=0.15, p=0.0004). Similar trends were observed for FOLFIRINOX-induced CIPN in PDAC pts. In mice, CIPN was linked to infiltration of myeloid cells and inflammatory cytokines in dorsal root ganglia. Co-administration of the nadunolimab surrogate completely abrogated CIPN. Ongoing studies aim to confirm the effects of the nadunolimab surrogate on ADC payload-induced neuropathy.Conclusion:Overall, our current findings in conjunction with previous results, suggest that nadunolimab may not only offer anti-tumor benefits but also protection against the neuro-inflammatory component driving chemotherapy- and ADC-induced neuropathy.Citation Format:Samuel Le Sourd, Rocio Garcia-Carbonero, Sandrine Hiret, Elin Jaensson Gyllenback, Camilla Rydberg Millrud, Lars Thorsson, Svetlana Shatunova, Irina Vetter, Hana Starobova, David Liberg.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM:Trophoblast cell surface antigen-2 (TROP2), a transmembrane glycoprotein often overexpressed in a variety of cancers, has been proposed as a potential cancer driver in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. As a result, several antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) have been developed targeting TROP2, such as Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) and Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-Dxd). One of the major challenges in the development of ADC is the emergence of resistance via different mechanism of actions. This study aims to characterize the potential resistant mechanisms of TROP2 ADCs, including a novel TROP2 ADC OBI-992 in CRC cells.METHODS:DLD1 CRC cells resistant to OBI-992, SG, and Dato-Dxd analogs were established with sequential increase of respective ADC concentrations. Cytotoxicity of three ADCs and their payloads, including exatecan, SN-38, and Dxd, was evaluated to assess the fold of resistance. Cell surface and total TROP2 protein were measured by flow cytometry and western blotting. DNA mutation and gene expression profiling were conducted by whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).RESULTS:TROP2 reduction and multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs) enhancement were not detected in OBI-992-induced resistant cells. Notable different DNA mutations in ATRX, BRCA2, and PALB2 of OBI-992 resistant cells were detected compared to those found with Dato-Dxd and SG-selected resistant cells. A TOP1 inhibitor-resistant mutation, TOP1 R364H, was identified as 100% variant allele frequency (VAF) in Dato-Dxd and SG resistant cells, whereas lower percentage of VAF was observed in OBI-992 resistant cell lines (29 % and 48.6 % in 0.5 uM and 2uM of OBI-992, respectively). OBI-992 resistant cells showed a clear divergence in differential expression gene (DEG) profiles, whereas Dato-Dxd and SG resistant cells were similar. c-MET and REG4 levels were greatly increased in cells with Dato-Dxd and SG resistance but not with OBI-992. Extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction pathway was enriched in OBI-992 resistant cells.CONCLUSION:OBI-992, a novel TROP2 targeting ADC, emerges as a potential promising therapeutic option for patients who are resistant to other TROP2 targeting ADCs such as SG and Dato-Dxd. OBI-992 exhibits distinct resistance profiles compared to other TROP2 targeting ADCs. Understanding of potential mechanisms of resistance can provide potential combination options for TROP2-targeting ADCs to combat the drug resistance.Citation Format:Lifen Shen, Tzer-Min Kuo, Yu-Hsuan Tsao, Ya-Chi Chen, Ming-Tain Lai.

    "abstract": "Background:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as the HER2-targeting agent trastuzumab deruxtecan, the TROP-2 targeting agent sacituzumab govitecan, and the NECTIN4 targeting agent enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, have resulted in increased clinical response rates in previously difficult to treat solid tumor indications, but only a minority of patients exhibit such responses. Increased understanding of the molecular underpinnings of sensitivity and resistance to ADCs beyond membranous target expression is needed. To that end, we developed a platform for generating, deeply characterizing, and functionally screening extensive panels of patient-derived organoids. Here, to demonstrate feasibility, we report on a screening panel of 60 PDOs representing 10 solid tumor indications and focus on response to ADCs now widely used in the clinical setting: trastuzumab deruxtecan and sacituzumab govitecan.Methods:PDOs were cultured in the presence of 8-dose dilutions of either trastuzumab deruxtecan or sacituzumab govitecan as monotherapies. Experiments were performed in 384 well plates with each dose in technical triplicate. Cells were plated and drugs were added after 24 hours. Cells were cultured for an additional 6 days with no media refreshes. The screen included staurosporine as a positive control and vehicle negative controls. On Day 7, CellTiter-Glo (CTG) was added to the plates to terminate the experiments and assess cell viability. To evaluate treatment activity, cell viability measurements were normalized to vehicle controls and dose-response curves were generated to estimate key efficacy metrics including IC50, EC50, and inverse area under the curve (iAUC).Results:ADC specific responses were observed across the 60 models tested. As anticipated, response to ADC exposure was driven by target expression. This was most obvious in response to enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, and also observable to a lesser extent with sacituzumab govitecan and trastuzumab deruxtecan. To better understand other molecular indicators of response, differential gene expression analysis was performed. This revealed additional potential biomarkers of specific ADC response including VIL1, MYO7B, HNF4A, EFS, EPS8L3, and several of which interestingly regulate cell-cell junction proteins.Conclusions:The results shown here demonstrate that screening pan indication panels of PDOs can reveal ADC specific differences in efficacy which are rooted in molecular factors that include, but are not limited to target expression. Further analysis is ongoing, including establishing the prevalence of non-ADC target biomarkers in real-world patient populations via the projection of our screen-derived data onto Tempus RWD.Citation Format:Yi-Hung Carol Tan, Brandon L.

    "abstract": "Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) is often overexpressed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and several other neuroendocrine tumors, with no or very low expression in normal issues. An anti-DLL3 x CD3 bispecific T-cell engager, tarlatamab, has demonstrated significant clinical benefits and was recently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of DLL3-expressing SCLC. On the other hand, Rova-T, the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting DLL3 entered advanced clinical development, failed in phase III studies due to insufficient efficacy and an unfavorable safety profile. In this study, via AI-guided engineering and optimization, we produced a novel biparatopic anti-DLL3 antibody and generated a number of ADCs utilizing various linkers and cytotoxic payloads. The ADCs demonstrated efficient DLL3-mediated cell binding and rapid internalization at a much higher efficiency than the mono-epitope targeting ADCs. The ADCs showed selective cytotoxicity towards multiple tumor cell lines with varying levels of DLL3 expression in vitro, and potently inhibited the growth of several DLL3-expressing tumor xenografts in animal models. Taken together, our findings underscore the significance of AI-guided antibody engineering and optimization, and provide support for the further development of the biparatopic anti-DLL3 ADCs in patients with DLL3-expressing tumors such as SCLC and other neuroendocrine tumors.Citation Format:Chuan Chen, Yue Wu, Liang Tian, Chenpeng Su, Zhaohui Chen, Jiyuan Tian, Dandan Liu, Yang He, Xiaoqian chen, Yongxin Shang, Jian Peng, Zhenping Zhu.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have revolutionized targeted cancer therapy by delivering potent cytotoxic agents directly to tumor cells. Recent approvals of ADCs such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, sacituzumab govitecan have significantly improved patient treatment options, underscoring the clinical potential of this therapeutic class. However, single-payload ADCs often face limitations in efficacy. Tumor heterogeneity poses a significant challenge, as targeting cancer cells with a single cytotoxic mechanism may not sufficiently overcome resistance or achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes. These limitations call for the development of novel strategies that widen the therapeutic index by increasing the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and lowering the Minimum Effective Dose (MED). We have designed and synthesized a novel dual-payload ADC combining two distinct cytotoxic agents: a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor (Top1i) and a microtubule-disrupting agent. This innovative approach allows for a synergistic therapeutic effect, leveraging the complementary mechanisms of action of both payloads within a single ADC. In vitro cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo assay against the NCI-N87 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. These studies demonstrated robust potency of the dual-payload ADC across multiple cancer cell lines. In vivo efficacy studies were conducted in HER2-expressing NCI-N87 gastric cancer xenograft model. The tumor-bearing mice were treated with various doses of dual-payload ADC, single-payload ADC, or saline control. Notably, dual-payload ADC displayed superior efficacy compared to single-payload ADC, achieving a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 103% (p < 0.05). This demonstrates superior tumor growth inhibition of the dual-payload ADC compared to a Top1i-based single-payload ADC and a more favorable safety profile compared to a microtubule inhibitor-based single-payload ADC. Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling and non-GLP toxicity studies are currently underway to further characterize its suitability for clinical development. Moreover, we have explored combination strategies to further augment the therapeutic index. One promising approach involves the combination of the ADC with NTX-301, a novel 4\u2032-thio-modified analog of decitabine (DAC). NTX-301 enhances p53 stabilization more effectively than DAC, potentially improving the ADC\u2019s efficacy through synthetic lethality with BCL2 inhibition. Preliminary data suggest that the ADC+NTX-301 combination produces greater synergy and a more favorable therapeutic index than ADC combinations with traditional hypomethylating agents (HMAs). In this study, we present novel strategies to enhance the therapeutic index of ADCs through a dual-payload design and combination with NTX-301. These results highlight the potential of both approaches for further development in cancer treatment.Citation Format:Younghwa Chun, Areum Go, Byeong Sung Lee, Seunggun Shin, Sohui Kweon, Hyemin Han, JaeHyeon Lee, Suhyun Park, Ha Young Lee, Min Young Lee, Hyun Yong Cho, Doo Young Jung.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are therapeutic compounds designed to exert targeted toxicity as compared to conventional chemotherapy. The conjugation of a cytotoxic payload to an antibody trough a chemical linker serves to lower the systemic toxicity and thereby increase the therapeutic window. However, an enhanced understanding of the mechanism of action of ADCs is needed, as little is known about how these drugs are trafficked and processed within the cell.The tumor-targeted activity of ADCs depend on the presence of target molecules on the tumor cell surfaces, and the overall response of ADCs is generally dependent on the expression level of these surface receptors. However, ADCs are dependent on cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking for the cytotoxic payload to be released and reach its target within the cell. This process of endocytosis and subsequent intracellular trafficking is regulated by a group of small molecular switches called Rab GTPases. These proteins acts as key regulators of the endo/lysosomal machinery, and we hypothesized them to impact ADC efficacy.We used cell lines from breast and lung cancer origin to study the mechanism of action of different ADCs dependent on RAB5 and RAB4 expression. We have found that the makeup of the ADC - comprising the antibody moiety, linker design, and choice of payload - dictates how it is taken up and processed, and thereby determines which Rab GTPases are critical for its therapeutic effect. Our results demonstrate how ADC design influences intracellular trafficking and processing, and points towards linker design as a major regulator of the intracellular fate of an ADC.Citation Format:Astrid Medhus, Kay Oliver Schink, Ane Sager Longva, Olav Engebraaten, Kristian Berg, Anette Weyergang.

    "abstract": "Endoglin (CD105), a TGFb-RII co-factor, overexpressed in tumor microvasculature and endothelial-derived CAFs, has been extensively validated as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Endoglin-targeting ADCs have been developed in this work, using a human IgG1 antibody, OMTX003, conjugated to different microtubule inhibitors such as eribulin (OMTX603-3) or MMAE (OMTX103), with DAR values between 4 and 8. Target binding was maintained within subnanomolar values for each ADC, similar to the unconjugated antibody. Internalization was efficient, with 75% intracellular localization within 60 minutes, regardless of the conjugated payload. In vitro activity in Endoglin-expressing HT1080 cells was target- and concentration-dependent, with IC50 values of 6 and 95.5pM, respectively. ADCs were tested for their in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in a gastric cancer PDX murine model. Complete tumor regression was observed. No re-growth occurred up to 40 days after treatment end, showing the lack of resistance to treatment. ADCs were well tolerated with no weight loss. These encouraging results are postulating these anti-ENG ADCs for further development.Citation Format:Isabel Ega\u00f1a, Patricia Gonz\u00e1lez-Callejo, Alvaro Gonz\u00e1lez, Cristina Ferrer, Roland Kontermann, Oliver Seifer, Klaus Pfizenmaier, Myriam Fabre.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Telisotuzumab Vedotin (Teliso-V), a first-in-class c-Met-MMAE antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), achieved FDA breakthrough therapy designation in c-Met overexpressing (OE), 2nd Line+ EGFR wild-type, non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In addition, in a phase 1/1b trial, Teliso-V demonstrated 50% response in combination with the EGFR inhibitor, osimertinib, in EGFR mutant (EGFR-MT) NSCLC patients who had progressed on osimertinib. Here, we present mechanistic insights into the combinatorial effects of Teliso-V with osimertinib in this patient population.Methods:EGFR-MT NSCLC cell lines were exposed to osimertinib and subjected to RNA expression, mutation, EGFR-interactome, and ADC intracellular localization and endolysosomal (EL) trafficking analysis.Results:While no mutation gains or losses were detected, chronic and acute treatment with osimertinib enhanced Teliso-V sensitivity in EGFR-MT NSCLC cells. In addition to enhanced Teliso-V cytotoxicity, we observed enhanced accumulation of Teliso-V in a low pH intracellular compartment, consistent with increased endolysosome (EL) trafficking. Chronic osimertinib exposure induced gene expression changes related to increased lysosomal membranes, lytic vacuole membranes, and endoplasmic reticulum as well as reduced EGFR signaling. In addition to osimertinib, other EGFR inhibitors including erlotinib, gefitnib, or afatinib also enhanced Teliso-V EL trafficking which is consistent with the effect of EGFR-MT signaling in suppressing c-Met ADC EL trafficking. Cells harboring EGFR-MT are known to form large multimeric protein complexes to regulate EGFR trafficking and cell survival. EGFR-MT immunoprecipitation, followed by mass spectrometry analysis identified 84 proteins associated with an osimertinib-sensitive complex including c-Met, and caveolin-1 (CAV-1), a structural protein involved in signaling and trafficking. Confocal microscopy imaging showed that osimertinib treatment altered the subcellular localization of these proteins and their interaction with CAV-1. CAV-1 knockdown disrupted the multimeric protein complex, suppressed EGFR and c-Met activation, reduced downstream AKT/ERK signaling, and enhanced Teliso-V-associated EL trafficking, phenocopying osimertinib effect.Conclusions:Chronic and acute treatment with osimertinib displaces EGFR/c-Met/CAV-1 multimeric signaling complexes leading to improved lysosomal processing of c-Met-targeted ADCs and enhanced tumor cytotoxicity. This study provides mechanistic insights into the combination of Teliso-V and osimertnib in 2L+ EGFRMT NSCLC patients in the clinic.Citation Format:Izhar Batth, Ronald Pandoy, Lisa Roberts-Rapp, Athan Vasilopoulos, Peter Ansell, Vincent Blot, Gregory K.

    "abstract": "Background:Several HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness on HER2-expressing cancer. However, these ADCs still face challenge of disease progression in most patients due to diverse resistance mechanisms. Herein, we report preclinical studies of iSAP-0913, a novel in vivo self-assembled peptide-drug conjugate (PDC) targeting HER2. iSAP-0913 demonstrates significant antitumor activity in both in vitro and in vivo models, overcoming the resistance of HER2 ADCs with Topo I inhibitor payload.Method:The strategy of in vivo self-assembly was leveraged to construct iSAP-0913 with a HER2 targeting peptide possessing binding epitopes located in domain II of HER2, a tubulin inhibitor MMAE, and a self-assembling peptide linker. A series of in vitro assays were conducted to evaluate biological functions and anti-tumor activities. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy was assessed in a DS8201-induced NCI-N87 resistance model. Preliminary safety of iSAP-0913 was evaluated by repeated dose toxicity (DRF) study in cynomolgus monkeys.Results:iSAP-0913 binds HER2 receptor to form nano-assemblies on tumor cells, contributed by the design of self-assembling peptide sequence in linker. As a result, in vivo self-assembled PDC monomers accumulate in tumor lesions through assembly induced retention (AIR) effect. In NCI-N87 cells, the payload delivery efficiency of iSAP-0913 was 2-3 times higher than that of HER2 ADCs. Desorption Electrospray Ionization imaging results demonstrated that iSAP-0913 exhibits significantly enhanced tumor tissue penetration compared to HER2 ADCs (DS8201, RC-48) in NCI-N87 xenograft tumor models. iSAP-0913 induced tumor-growth suppression, even regression in in vivo models with 1-3 mg/kg dosage. iSAP-0913 also showed more effective tumor suppression with TGI% of 73.4% in xenograft models established with DS8201 induced resistant cells, whereas DS8201 exerted negligible anti-tumor activity (TGI%<19.6%). Tissue distribution studies in NCI-N87 tumor-bearing mice revealed that both iSAP-0913 and MMAE are rapidly cleared from plasma. However, MMAE exhibited an elimination half-life of up to 57 hours in the tumor lesion, which may be attributed to the AIR effect. Preliminary repeat-dose toxicological assessment of iSAP-0913 in pharmacologically relevant species cynomolgus monkey demonstrated that iSAP-0913 is well tolerated with no signs of lung toxicity. TK data showed that free MMAE in plasma is 1/100th of iSAP-0913, without MMAE accumulation during dosage.Conclusion:Comprehensive preclinical data have supported iSAP-0913 as a promising PDC candidate for HER2-low expression and/or patients insensitive to other HER2-targeting ADCs, particularly as a sequential treatment following resistance to HER2 ADCs. iSAP-0913 is now undergoing preclinical development.Citation Format:Gantian Lyu, Min Han, Yuzhen Qian, Yingbin Zhang, Lin Fu, Hao Wang.

    "abstract": "Traditional ADC technologies require overexpressed targets, high internalization and efficient intracellular processing. To this end, a non-internalized antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting soluble VEGF was developed using MediLink\u2019s TMALIN\u00ae platform. VEGF is overexpressed in virtually all human tumors and contributes to key aspects of tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. YL242 incorporates an anti-VEGF antibody, protease-cleavable tripeptide linker and novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. It introduces a novel cleavage mechanism that occurs in the tumor microenvironment while stable during systemic circulation. YL242 is designed to leverage anticancer activity through both anti-angiogenesis by the VEGF antibody and the cytotoxicity of the extracellularly released payload. The linker of YL242 can be enzymatically cleaved by enzymes in TME (tumor microenvironment) to release payload C24, subsequently inducing cytotoxic effects to kill cancer cells. Significant dose-dependent antitumor effects, including complete tumor regressions were observed in tumor xenograft mouse models. The stability of YL242 has been demonstrated by incubation with various plasmas under physiological conditions. This high stability was further evidenced by the pharmacokinetic profiles in non-human primate (NHP) studies, where both the ADC and TAb curves are overlapped. YL242 demonstrated promising safety profiles in pivotal non-human primate (NHP) toxicity studies with no drug-related adverse effects observed. In summary, VEGF-targeted ADC YL242 synergistically combines both antitumor activity of cytotoxic payload and anti-angiogenesis effect of antibody and demonstrated both antitumor efficacy and safety. Consequently, YL242 holds promise for further development in the treatment of cancer patients.Citation Format:Tongtong Xue, Wei Lian, Qing Zong, Chun Deng, Qigang Liu, Peng Zou, Jiaqiang Cai.

    "abstract": "Background:BTCs are an uncommon malignancy with poor prognosis. ADCs have efficacy in several solid tumors with antigen surface expression serving as a potential biomarker in some instances. Herein, we evaluate the protein expression and heterogeneity of ADC target antigens and their prognostic implications in BTC.Methods:Utilizing an IRB-approved, retrospective biospecimen protocol, we constructed tissue microarrays (TMA) from resected, early staged intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (EHC) and gallbladder cancer (GB). IHC for Nectin-4, TROP2, c-MET, CLDN18.2 was assessed. Positivity defined as \u226510% weakly stained tumor cells and quantified by H-score (intensity \u00d7 percentage). HER2 IHC scored per standard colon criteria. Clinicopathological factors and outcomes were associated with ADC target expression.Results:N=65 resected cases were selected (median age 72 years (range 36-92); 55% males, anatomical subtype 40% IHC, 43% EHC, 17% GB; 84% moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. c-MET and TROP2 were expressed in 75% and 83% of cases with differential expression based on anatomic site (c-MET: IHC: 62%, EHC: 89% vs GB: 73%, p=0.049; TROP2: IHC: 65%, EHC: 93% vs GB: 100%, p=0.010, Table). HER2, CLDN18.2, and Nectin-4 were expressed in 7.7%, 46%, and 66% of cases, and did not differ based on anatomic site. Median RFS and OS were 20 (95%CI 10-NR) and 40 (95%CI 27-NR) months respectively and outcomes were not impacted by expression of HER2, Nectin-4, TROP2, c-MET, or CLDN18.2.Conclusion:Modest to high expression of Nectin-4, TROP2, c-MET and CLDN18.2 was identified across BTC anatomic subtypes, suggesting a potential role for ADCs to these antigens in patients with BTC. Preclinical validation is ongoing in BTC patient derived xenografts with trastuzumab deruxtecan (HER2 sensitive and HER2 resistant models), enfortumab vendotin (Nectin-4 positive model), and sacituzumab govitecan and these results will be presented at the meeting.

    "abstract": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the folate receptor family, is highly expressed in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and increases following androgen deprivation therapy. TD001 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a deimmunized anti-PSMA IgG1 monoclonal antibody (HuJ591), which binds to the extracellular domain of PSMA, conjugated to a proprietary cleavable topoisomerase I inhibitor exatecan linker-payload (LD038), with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy show TD001 is internalized and cleaved rapidly, colocalizing with lysosomes in PSMA-expressing tumor cells. TD001 (10-20 mg/kg IV) was evaluated in a human CRPC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model, LNCaP-abl with high PSMA expression, in castrated NSG mice, with a range of tumor sizes (from 150 to 700 mm3) at the time of treatment. TD001 gave dose-dependent and sustained potent activity (tumor growth inhibition [TGI] >80%) with single dosing. Sustained inhibition of regrowth for 20 days was observed after TD001 10 mg/kg even in large tumors up to 400 mm3. Strong antitumoral activity of a single dose of TD001 10 mg/kg was also observed even in tumors >400 mm3 at the time of treatment. Tumor regrowth was faster in larger tumors (mean volume \u223c300-400 mm3) compared to smaller tumors (mean volume \u223c200 mm3). PSMA expression was unchanged in tumor regrowth between treated and vehicle control in the CDX castrated mouse model after treatment with TD001 up to 20 mg/kg, indicating no impact on target expression. Fractionation of a single TD001 dose into 2 or 3 doses administered every 10 days resulted in a 2-3 fold higher therapeutic index (TGI >90%) compared to the equivalent higher single isodose. No mortality or weight loss was reported. Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic correlations of TD001 are described separately. TD001 appears as a best-in-class anti-PSMA Topo I inhibitor ADC (exatecan payload), and exhibited potent and sustained antitumor activity, including in large tumors, and represents a promising new treatment for PSMA-expressing CRPC patients.Citation Format:Roberta Frapolli, Ezia Bello, Marina Meroni, Daniela Impellizzieri, Elisa Storelli, Carlo V.

    "abstract": "Background:Somatic mutations in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene occur in several cancer types, including bladder, colorectal, lung and cervical. Multiple antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) molecules and small molecule treatments targeting HER2 have been approved; however, comparative in vivo sensitivity of these therapies toward known and novel HER2 mutations is unclear. To better understand the effects of these targeted therapies on specific HER2 variants, we established and characterized a panel of XPDX models harboring various HER2 mutations and benchmarked in vivo sensitivity to targeting ADCs and small molecule therapies.Methods:18 XPDX models were included in this study. Models representing the S310F mutation in the extracellular domain included ST174 (bile duct), ST524 (colorectal), ST1243 (lung) and ST5025B (bladder) and one cervical model (STM602) with a reported S310Y variant. Models harboring an R678Q mutation in the juxtamembrane domain included ST022 (ovary), ST026 (colorectal) and STF001 (pancreas). Models with mutations in the kinase domain included ST5960 breast (Y735C), STF117 lung (L755F), ST1616B breast (D769Y), ST2594 colorectal (D769Y), ST427 colorectal (V777L), ST4295 ovary (S792F), and ST1456 breast (V842I). Two models ST3107 (lung) and STF059 (colorectal), harboring a YVMA insertion, and the ST3013 (lung) with a 776-777 G/LC indel were also evaluated. Models were characterized for HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry and profiled using WES and RNAseq. For in vivo studies, T-DXd, T-DM1, neratinib, tucatinib, and afatinib were evaluated at standard treatment regimens. Study endpoints included tumor volume and time from treatment initiation with %T/C values and tumor regression reported at study completion; a %T/C of \u2264 20 versus control was considered sensitive. Tumor regression (%T/C<0%) versus Day 0 tumor volume was also reported.Results:The majority of models stained for HER2 at 2+ or 3+ and RNA based expression correlated with IHC results. In vivo, T-DXd or T-DM1 treatment resulted in regressions in ST1243 and ST3013 but were ineffective toward ST5025B. Neratinib reported activity toward ST5025B (%T/C=-80%), ST3107 (%T/C=1%), and ST3013 (%T/C=2%) while tucatinib was found efficacious toward ST5025B (%T/C=12%) and STF117 (%T/C=13%). Afatinib treatment resulted in regressions toward ST427 (%T/C=-25%) and was active in ST3013 (%T/C=8%).Conclusion:We have established and characterized a panel of XPDX models harboring various HER2 mutations and benchmarked in vivo sensitivity toward targeting ADCs and small molecule therapies. This data and model panel can be utilized as a valuable tool in better understanding the utility of HER2-targeting therapies in HER2-mutated cancers.Citation Format:Andre Villegas, Johnnie R.

    "abstract": "Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) presents a significant therapeutic challenge due to limited treatment options. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in mCRPC tumors, making it a viable target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). We developed SDV2102, a novel PSMA-targeting ADC designed to enhance tumor penetration and efficacy. SDV2102 utilizes a novel anti-PSMA antibody, D10, selected for its superior antigen-binding properties. The D10 antibody is conjugated with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a tubulin-binding cytotoxic agent to which mCRPC tumors are inherently more sensitive than to topoisomerase I inhibitors. Notably, SDV2102 has a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 1, allowing for higher dosing and increased efficacy without proportional increases in systemic toxicity, thereby improving the therapeutic index. In vivo efficacy was assessed using the C4-2 cell-derived xenograft (CDX) model, characterized by high PSMA expression. SDV2102 demonstrated significantly greater anti-tumor efficacy than classical DAR4 ADCs constructed with either the generic J591 antibody or the D10 antibody when administered at equivalent doses of MMAE. Additionally, SDV2102 showed potent activity in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with low to moderate PSMA expression levels, with some tumors expressing as few as 25, 000 receptors per cell. This indicates that SDV2102 may be effective across a spectrum of PSMA expression in mCRPC tumors. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats revealed that SDV2102 has a favorable profile, closely mirroring that of the unconjugated D10 antibody, suggesting maintained antibody-like characteristics in circulation. Dose-response studies in the C4-2 model identified a minimum effective dose of 2.5 mg/kg. Toxicology studies in non-human primates showed no major toxicities at doses up to 24 mg/kg, with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) not reached, indicating a wide therapeutic window. SDV2102 achieved a therapeutic index of 38, representing a substantial safety margin. These preclinical results support the advancement of SDV2102 into clinical trials as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of mCRPC.Citation Format:Damien Dattler, Fabian Schlimpen, Constantin Semenchenko, Oleksandr Koniev, Sergii Kolodych.

    "abstract": "Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), a non-classical MHC class I molecule, is expressed only in the placenta, where it functions as an immune suppressor to protect the fetus from maternal immune recognition. Recent studies have demonstrated that HLA-G is enriched in various malignant cells, providing evidence that HLA-G is strongly associated with tumor immune escape. HLA-G, a tumor-specific antigen, mediates immune suppression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages, by engaging inhibitory receptors such as Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2) and 4 (ILT4). Therefore, the development of an HLA-G-targeting ADC can be a novel therapeutic strategy not only to induce direct tumor cell killing through payload delivery upon binding to HLA-G, but also to take advantage of the fact that HLA-G is minimally expressed on normal cells and predominantly restricted to tumor cells. This selective expression pattern makes HLA-G a promising target compared to other cancer antigens, in which off-target effects on normal tissues are expected to be minimal. Moreover, by disrupting the interaction between HLA-G and inhibitory receptors such as ILT2, this approach enhances anti-tumor immunity, followed by boosting immune activation and improving therapeutic outcomes. We developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting HLA-G (IMB-201) to selectively deliver cytotoxic drugs to HLA-G-expressing tumor cells, thereby overcoming immune suppression and promoting tumor regression. We generated a monoclonal antibody specific to HLA-G and conjugated it with a potent cytotoxic drug via a stable linker. The IMB-201 demonstrated high binding affinity and selectivity for HLA-G-positive tumor cells. In vitro serum and preliminary stability assays confirmed that the stability of IMB-201 is comparable to that of other developed ADCs. In vitro studies revealed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity when treated to HLA-G-expressing cell lines, with minimal off-target effects on HLA-G-negative cells. In vivo studies employing mouse models demonstrated significant tumor regression and prolonged survival. Collectively, the IMB-201 could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of HLA-G-positive solid tumors, such as gastric and pancreatic cancers. As HLA-G is a tumor-specific antigen, it has the potential to widen the therapeutic index (TI) compared to other conventional therapies. This strategy selectively targets tumor cells, delivering cytotoxic agents and enhancing immune response, thereby overcoming immune evasion mechanisms.Citation Format:Hyeonju Kang, Inyoung Lee, Joseph Kim, Yoojin Kim, Sungmuk Kang, Yongjun Kang, Hongjai Lee, Chungmin Lee, Chihye Park, Gyongsik Ha.

    "abstract": "Background:Enhertu\u00ae/DS-8201, a HER2-directed ADC, has been used for the treatment of multiple tumor types, including HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer, HER2-mutant NSCLC, HER2-positive gastric cancer, etc. Despite Enhertu\u2019s success as a breakthrough therapy, significant unmet need remains in the HER2-low settings and in the occurrence of secondary resistance. Dual targeting of EGFR and HER2 represents a promising approach to the treatment of HER2-low patients and to overcoming drug resistance, as they are both oncogenic drivers and widely co-expressed. We developed GenSci139, an EGFR\u00d7HER2 bispecific ADC with a highly stable but cleavable linker and a potent topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload, using our proprietary platform technologies. Preclinical studies are underway to evaluate the potential of GenSci139 as a novel targeted therapy across multiple solid tumor types.Methods:GenSci139\u2019s plasma stability, in vitro cellular binding, internalization, cytotoxicity, and bystander effect, and blocking activity of GenSci139 or its parental bispecific antibody on EGFR/HER2 signaling in a number of human cancer cell lines were characterized. In vivo anti-tumor activity of GenSci139 was evaluated in a number of human cancer CDX models in mice. In addition, the ability of GenSci139 to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in tumor cell cultures was assessed.Results:GenSci139 showed much better in vitro plasma stability than DS-8201, suggesting a favorable PK and safety profile. GenSci139 exhibited stronger in vitro tumor cell binding and internalization activities than DS-8201 and potent direct cytotoxicity and bystander killing effect in tumor cell lines. The parental bispecific antibody of GenSci139 inhibited EGF-induced signaling and cell proliferation in tumor cell culture. GenSci139 demonstrated superior in vivo anti-tumor efficacy versus DS-8201 in a number of CDX models in mice. In addition, GenSci139 was shown to induce hallmarks of ICD in tumor cells, providing a complementary anti-tumor mechanism when in a combination therapy regimen with immune checkpoint inhibitors.Conclusion:These data suggest the potential of GenSci139 as a novel and effective therapy across a variety of tumor types, including urothelial cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, etc., and support its further evaluation in IND-enabling studies.Citation Format:Xiaojuan Chai, Fu Li, Hongmei Xie, Yuting Lu, Nan Li, Hanxi Yu, Li Tong, Weiming He, Wenqiang Zhai, Fanglong Yang, John L.

    "abstract": "Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) continues to pose a significant clinical challenge and is associated with poor survival rates in patients who failed previous lines of androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies and taxanes. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) provide a novel approach to traditional chemotherapy by targeting tumor-specific antigens to deliver cytotoxic payloads while sparing normal tissue and enhancing the therapeutic index. Herein, we describe the preclinical characterization of AZD0516, a first-in-class ADC directed against six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate-2 (STEAP2), a novel tumor associated antigen that is highly and homogenously expressed across all stages of prostate cancer. The anti-STEAP2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is conjugated via interchain cysteines to a maleimide-reactive, \u03b2-glucuronidase-cleavable linker bearing the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) payload, exatecan. The STEAP2 antibody binds specifically to the extracellular domains of human, cynomolgus monkey, mouse, and rat STEAP2, but exhibits no detectable binding to other STEAP family members. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the antibody binder portion carries three amino acid point mutations designed to reduce Fc-mediated immune effector functions. In vitro characterization of the STEAP2 mAb in prostate cancer cells demonstrated specific binding, rapid internalization, and efficient lysosomal trafficking. In vitro cytotoxicity assays with AZD0516 revealed IC50 values in the low nM range and the ADC induced both single- and double-strand DNA breaks, characteristic of the proposed primary mechanism of action (MoA) of the TOP1i payload, namely, DNA damage and apoptotic cell death. Exatecan-driven bystander cell killing from intracellular release of payload was demonstrated in co-culture systems involving STEAP2-positive and negative cell lines. Murine plasma pharmacokinetic data suggest minimal impact of linker-payload conjugation on antibody clearance, while maintaining high plasma stability. The mechanistic and pharmacodynamic effects of AZD0516 were observed in a prostate cancer cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model via a dose-dependent increase in positive staining for \u03b3H2AX foci, indicative of DNA damage. AZD0516 monotherapy administration in prostate cancer CDX and patient-derived xenograft models led to sustained tumor responses. AZD0516 was well-tolerated in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys with no unexpected toxicities observed. Safety findings included hematological and gastrointestinal effects, consistent with the MoA and known effects of TOP1i payloads. Together, these data support exploring AZD0516 clinically for patients with mCRPC.Citation Format:Darlene Monlish, Vanessa Muniz-Medina, Mel Ehudin, Dewald van Dyk, Claire Myers, Rachel Lawrence, Liang Zhang, Linda Irons, Chara Stavraka, Wardha Qureshi, Ruoyan Chen, Asurayya Worrede, Nicolas Giraldo, Miljenka Vuko, Melody Handali, Ali Saleh, Balakumar Vijayakrishnan, Maximillian Lee, Jeong Min Han, Crystal Cheung, Ariel Endlich-Frazier, Amber Lee, Mark Hutchinson, Andrew Dippel, Gilad Kaplan, Keith Rickert, Shraddha Kale, Ryan Fleming, Clare Hoover, Benedicte Recolin, Jan Zaucha, Sreedevi Kesavan, John` Meekin, Aida Mariani, Christian Eisen, John Bullen, Eric Gangl, Jay Harper, Andreas Maderna, Edward Rosfjord, Frank Comer, Elaine Hurt, Neil Gibson, Puja Sapra.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Cadherin 17 (CDH17) is a cell-to-cell adhesion protein that is a member of the cadherin superfamily. CDH17 is frequently overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (GC) and pancreas cancer (PC)1. HDM2017 ADC comprises a human monoclonal antibody specifically targeting CDH17 and chemically conjugated to CPT-derivative payloads. HDM2017 is undergoing IND-enabling studies.Methods:In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies were conducted in the discovery of HDM2017 against gastrointestinal cancers. Initial investigations on plasma stability were performed. Exploratory toxicity assessments were carried out in cynomolgus monkeys and rats.Results:HDM2017 demonstrates excellent cell binding activities with CRC and GC cells, with an EC50 ranging between 0.1-1.0nM. Additionally, HDM2017 exhibits strong target-mediated internalization activities, achieving an internalization efficiency of 43-75%. The HDM2017 ADC displays potent expression-dependent in vitro anti-tumor activity in a range of CDH17 expressing tumor cell lines. Treatment with HDM2017 ADC resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth in xenograft models of CDH17+ human CRC (71\u223c97% TGI) and GC (71\u223c90% TGI). HDM2017 ADC exhibited excellent stability in human, monkey, and rat plasma with a drug shedding rate below 0.5%. Toxicity studies primarily revealed payload-related toxicity profile, which supports further development of the ADC molecule. Analysis using CDH17 IHC assay on patient tissues showed detectable expression of CDH17 in 90% (29/29) cases of colorectal cancer, 70% (7/10) cases of gastric cancer and 65% (13/20) cases of pancreas cancer.Conclusion:HDM2017ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity in various gastrointestinal cancer models. The preclinical activity and safety profile warrants further clinical development with biomarker strategy. Overall, the preclinical data presented here suggests that HDM2017 ADC has the potential to provide clinical benefit to gastrointestinal cancer patients.Citation Format:Chen Lin, Yan Xia, Liubin Guo, Yang Chen, Tingyang Wang, Kuan Lu, Hao Pan, Yayun Zhao, Jie Fang, Hongwen Li, Dongzhou Jeffery Liu.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the targeting ability of antibodies with the killing power of cytotoxins, allowing for the release of highly toxic payloads within tumor cells, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. ADCs have demonstrated significant efficacy as monotherapy in the treatment of various tumors. However, like many cytotoxic agents, the issue of drug resistance limits the sustained efficacy they can achieve as standalone treatments. To overcome this challenge, the combined application of ADCs with other therapies is becoming a new focus of research. Among these, the combination of immuno-oncology inhibitors (IO) with ADCs has shown strong therapeutic potential in clinical settings. An appropriate preclinical evaluation model can effectively assess the therapeutic potential of ADCs.Biocytogen developed a HER2-expressing MC38 cell line called B-hHER2 MC38 plus. The HER2 expression level of B-hHER2 MC38 plus is similar to that of the human cell line NCI-N87, and it can form tumors normally in B-hHER2 mice. In a syngeneic transplantation model of B-hHER2 mice with MC38 plus cells, the anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) analogous to trastuzumab, MMAE, exhibited a dose-dependent tumor suppression effect. When combined with the anti-mPD-1 antibody, it demonstrated a higher tumor suppression rate. In another syngeneic transplantation model where B-hHER2 MC38 plus cells were inoculated into B-h4-1BB/hHER2 mice, the commercial product DS8201 showed significant tumor growth inhibition. In the xenograft models using a diverse array of human tumor tissues - including breast cancer tumor tissues (BP0818 and BP1056), colorectal cancer tumor tissues (BP0170 and BP0847), lung cancer tumor tissues (BP0508 and BP0638), as well as breast cancer cell lines (BT-474 and MDA-MB-231), and the gastric cancer cell line (NCI-N87) - the commercial product DS8201 demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition.Citation Format:Jean Huang, Chong Li, Ruili Lv, Qinjun Wang, Qingqing Xu, Heling Shen, Xiaofei Zhou.

    "abstract": "Background:Cadherin 17 (CDH17) is a cell adhesion protein that belongs to the cadherin superfamily. CDH17 is highly restricted to tight junctions in normal gastrointestinal (GI) tissues. In contrast, CDH17 is frequently overexpressed and becomes accessible to targeted therapeutics in several GI malignancies, including colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers. This differential expression profile makes CDH17 a promising therapeutic target for antibody-based therapeutics, including ADCs. Here, we described the development and preclinical activity of BSI-721, a novel ADC that combines a fully humanized anti-CDH17 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a cleavable peptide linker.Methods:The anti-CDH17 mAb was generated from AceMouse\u2122 mice immunized with 293T cells overexpressing human full-length CDH17 and purified CDH17 extracellular domain recombinant protein, sequentially. Binding affinity of the anti-CDH17 mAb was assessed by surface plasmon resonance and flow cytometry. CDH17 expression as cell surface density on cancer cells was determined by quantitative flow cytometry. The anti-CDH17 mAb was conjugated to MMAE via a protease-cleavable valine-citrulline linker. Cytotoxicity of BSI-721 was evaluated in cell lines with varying endogenous expression levels of CDH17. In vivo, efficacy of BSI-721 was assessed in CDH17-high gastric and CDH17-moderate/low pancreatic CDX models.Results:The anti-CDH17 mAb showed strong binding affinity to both human and cynomolgus monkey CDH17 and cell lines with varying expression levels of CDH17. HIC-HPLC analysis revealed that MMAE was conjugated to the anti-CDH17 mAb in a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4 with a high yield of (among which, more than 50% conjugates carrying a DAR of 4). BSI-721 exhibited potent cytotoxicity against cell lines with varying expression levels of CDH17 (subnanomolar IC50). In CDH17-high gastric cancer model (SNU-5), treatment with BSI-721 resulted in significant tumor regression (with achievement of partial response) and tumor growth inhibition (TGI). BSI-721 also demonstrated a significant TGI in CDH17-moderate/low pancreatic cancer model (AsPC1). Additionally, candidate antibodies have been identified with potential to be developed into immunohistochemistry (IHC) companion diagnostic assay.Conclusion:These data highlight the potential of BSI-721 as an effective targeted therapy for GI malignancies with varying expression levels of CDH17. Further, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and IND-enabling studies of BSI-721 are underway.Citation Format:Xiaoyao Hao, Jingyu Liu, hongyan li, jun li, jialong wang, Hui-Han Hu, frank liu, mingjiu chen, Qun Lv.

    "abstract": "Background:Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapies like Enfortumab Vedotin (EV), targeting NECTIN4, are transforming cancer treatment, particularly for metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC). While single-agent EV and EV in combination with immunotherapy show promising results, long-term benefits are limited to a subset of patients, underscoring the challenges associated with its non-selective application. All-comer application of EV raises concerns about toxicity and cost, highlighting the necessity for more personalized approaches. ADCs targeting other tumor antigens, such as HER2, HER3 and EGFR, are in late-stage clinical development, emphasizing the importance of understanding spatial molecular target distributions in patient tissues. Spatial multi-omics and single cell technologies applicable to patient tissues like formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) open the possibility to unlock these spatial molecular profiles which ultimately could be used to identify companion diagnostic biomarkers and providing valuable insights into tumor microenvironment heterogeneity to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize off-target effects.Methods:The DECODE-ADC project integrates single-cell and spatial multi-omics data from FFPE tissues of EV-treated patients, encompassing matched pairs of primary tumors and metastatic biopsy from a cohort of 20 patients. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics were used to profile various ADC targets with additional markers of the tumor microenvironment and drug resistance (over 5000 gene panels). To bridge translational gaps, we employed machine learning (ML) models, such as variational autoencoders, to predict molecular signatures from routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stainings, enabling cost-effective clinical application.Results:Using spatial single-cell multiomics, we identified novel spatial domains regulating ADC target expression and delineated tumor microenvironment-specific signals. Unique molecular signatures distinguished luminal from basal urothelial cancer subtypes, revealing conserved microdomains across metastatic sites. Importantly, machine learning models transferred high-resolution molecular insights to H&E images, enabling precise, scalable predictions of ADC target distribution.Conclusions:DECODE-ADC provides unprecedented insights into the spatial dynamics of ADC targets within the tumor microenvironment of mUC.

    "abstract": "Background:Conventional antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) face significant challenges in treating solid tumors due to heterogeneous antigen expression or low antigen levels, resulting in suboptimal targeting and reduced therapeutic efficacy. While increasing the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) could enhance efficacy, traditional high-DAR approaches often compromise pharmacokinetics due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size. To address these limitations, we engineered a novel platform technology: a compact, 20-nm antibody drug-loaded unimicelle (unimer-micelle) conjugate (ADUC) utilizing single-chain polymer nanoparticles. This platform achieves an unprecedented DAR of approximately 40 while maintaining favorable physicochemical properties. Using this platform, we developed K-679, which combines cetuximab with DM1-loaded unimicelles.Methods:Antigen-binding specificity and cellular internalization of K-679 were evaluated using surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy. In vitro cytotoxicity, in vivo anti-tumor activities, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution were investigated in multiple human cancer cell lines and xenograft models. The bystander killing effect was quantified using an in vivo imaging system in mice co-inoculated with EGFR-positive and luciferase-expressing EGFR-negative cells. The benchmark ADCs were prepared by conventional conjugation of cetuximab with DM1.Results:K-679 exhibited EGFR-binding affinity equivalent to that of unconjugated cetuximab, efficient cellular internalization, and triggered cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell-growth inhibition in EGFR-positive cells, even in chemotherapeutic drug-resistant lines. In vivo studies demonstrated superior tumor-targeted delivery compared to conventional antibodies, and efficient payload release in tumors with minimal DM1 levels in circulation. This resulted in potent anti-tumor effects across multiple EGFR-positive tumor xenograft models, while showing no activity in EGFR-negative models. These observations reveal that K-679 mediates its anti-tumor effects in an EGFR-dependent manner through DM1-mediated cytotoxicity. Notably, K-679 showed significant bystander killing of EGFR-negative cells within heterogeneous tumors and exhibited efficacy in EGFR-low tumor models in which benchmark ADCs proved ineffective. Comparative studies further highlighted that K-679 outperformed lower-DAR variants at equivalent payload doses.Conclusion:Our findings establish K-679 as a promising therapeutic candidate for heterogeneous EGFR-expressing solid tumors, characterized by a more potent anti-tumor effect through an exceptionally high DAR, enhanced drug accumulation into tumors and significant bystander effect.Citation Format:Hideo Yoshida, Kenichi Suzuki, Kahori Hosono, Nobuhiro Fujimaki, Masaki Tamiya, Madoka Shiraishi, Hideyuki Higashi, Masato Mori.

    "abstract": "Introduction:B7-H7 is a member of the B7 family, with strong expression in multiple cancer indications in addition to its known role as an immune regulator. B7-H7 upregulation is correlated with poor patient outcomes. Furthermore, its normal tissue expression is limited making B7-H7 very attractive for targeting tumors. NextPoint has therefore explored B7-H7 as a novel antigen to target antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) to solid tumors. Antibodies previously raised against distinct B7-H7 epitopes, with cross-reactivity to the cynomolgus protein, were produced as ADCs and multiple distinct payload-linker technologies were applied. These were tested for in vitro and in vivo activity, and for their developability characteristics enabling lead selection of the most potent compounds.Methods:ADC binding efficacy was assessed by flow cytometry on endogenous B7-H7+ and overexpressing B7-H7 cell lines. Internalization was tracked with Fabfluor-pH reporter conjugated to ADCs using Incucyte\u00ae imaging. In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated by luminescence-based cell viability assays with CellTiter-Glo\u00ae to detect ATP in the media. The pharmacokinetics of each ADC was assessed in rats by measurement of both total and drug-conjugated antibody. The in vivo activity was tested against B7-H7-expressing xenograft tumors in immunodeficient mice.Results:The majority of B7-H7-targeted ADCs had similar on-cell binding capacities as parental antibodies. Internalization analyses showed that after 4h, over 50% of cells had internalized the compounds with an optimal concentration of 0.3 nM ADCs. Multiple B7-H7 targeted ADCs demonstrated cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines, with an in vitro EC50 under 0.3 nM on average and under 0.1 nM for the most potent compounds. Rat pharmacokinetics demonstrated half-lives above 7 days for the lead compounds and acceptable payload stability across technologies. In vivo, ADC leads were tested in several in vivo tumor models that cover a wide range ofB7-H7 protein expression. Selected ADC leads with distinct linker-payload technologies demonstrated tumor activity in multiple in vivo tumor models. Body weight changes were minimal following dosing of the most active ADCs in these mouse systems.Conclusions:Collectively, these preclinical studies establish B7-H7 as an attractive ADC targeting antigen and demonstrate its activity with multiple clinically relevant payload-linker technologies. These data support further development of lead compounds as a promising treatment for patients with B7-H7-expressing tumors.Citation Format:Emilien Loeuillard, Bijan A. Etemad-Gilbertson, Susannah L.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are pharmaceutical drugs that selectively deliver cytotoxic agents to cells expressing a specific target antigen (TA). Structurally, ADC consists of a highly specific monoclonal antibody linked to a cytotoxic payload. HUB patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are a unique in vitro 3D adult stem cell-based model. They closely resemble the architecture and physiology of the tissue of origin, maintaining the patient-specific genetic and phenotypic characteristics, including surface marker expression. This unique feature makes them a patient-relevant in vitro model for ADC screenings. The work presented here demonstrates the potential of the HUB PDO platform in an in vitro basket trial. Organoids derived from 7 different tissue origins were used for ADC screening, showcasing the platform's reliability and ability to assess ADC specificity, potency, and efficacy. ADCs directed to different TAs, such as Tissue Factor (F3) or trophoblast antigen 2 (TROP2), were tested, and organoid viability was assessed with CellTiter Glo\u00ae 3D after 7 days of treatment.Further parameters, such as TA expression and the percentage of the cell population expressing TA in each organoid, were evaluated by flow cytometry. The analysis of ADCs targeting F3 revealed an ADC-dependent organoid-killing correlation with F3 expression for a subset of PDOs across all different tumor tissue types. However, as observed in clinical trials, the impact of ADC on the viability of some PDOs was unrelated to F3 expression. The lack of correlation between ADC efficacy and target antigen expression was more evident for the TROP2 ADC. These findings underscore the importance of the study in understanding the differential activity between ADCs. Altogether, these results highlight the value of the PDO platform in assessing ADC target specificity and as a patient-relevant model to study the mechanism behind differential activity between ADCs such as antibody internalization dynamics or bystander effects.Citation Format:Daniele Mori, Claudia Beaurivage, Eider Valle Encinas, Yara Hendriksen, Anna Schepers, Foteini Gkogkou, Joris Maas, Ka Wai Lai, Mariana Silva, Sumeyra Mucuk, Vineeta Adegbenro, Ricardo Korporaal, Merel Derksen, Sylvia F.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) with pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer payloads have been explored preclinically and several PBD-based ADCs entered clinical trials. PBD dimers produce highly cytotoxic DNA crosslinks and thus have a mode-of-action differentiated from microtubule inhibitors, TOPO1 inhibitors and other DNA targeting warheads. In April 2021, the FDA approved the first PBD-based ADC, the CD19 targeting loncastuximab tesirine, for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, including DLBCL, after 2 or more lines of therapy. However, loncastuximab tesirine carries safety warnings - for example for effusion and edema, myelosuppression, and cutaneous reactions.While PBD-based ADCs show efficacy in the clinic, they belong to a highly potent payload class with IC50 values on human cancer cell lines in the picomolar range. In fact, the ultrapotent character of the vast majority of PBD-based ADCs has highly limited the administration at clinically suitable dosing regimens. Therefore, increasing the therapeutic dose and at the same time improving the therapeutic windows of PBD-based ADCs will be key for the next generation of PBD-ADCs.Although conjugation of linker-payload to the antibody is typically based on random conjugation to cysteine or lysine, we have shown that the native glycan of monoclonal antibodies is a privileged site for attachment of cytotoxic payloads1 (GlycoConnect\u00ae technology), while the therapeutic index is further elevated by a highly polar spacer technology (HydraSpace\u00ae)2. Complemented by a broad choice of payloads with various mode-of-action (toxSYN\u00ae platform), these joint technologies have been applied in multiple clinical programs up to phase 3.Our strategy to optimize the therapeutic potential of PBD-ADCs that incorporate GlycoConnect\u00ae and HydraSpace\u00ae technology further, is two-fold: (a) apply PBD dimer payload with reduced potency versus common clinical structures and (b) incorporate a pro-drug concept (proPBD-ADC) by shielding the PBD payload by a capping structure that is stable in circulation but at the same time conditionally released by tumor-associated proteases or under reducing conditions.Data from efficacy studies with HER2-proPBD-ADCs in CDX tumor bearing mouse models will be shared, as well as tolerability studies performed both in rats and in the chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. The data suggest that different cap structures of proPBD-ADCs, as well as the use of a PBD structure with attenuated potency, have a differential impact on efficacy and tolerability.1 (a) van Geel et al.

    "abstract": "B7H3 (CD276) belongs to the B7 superfamily of immune checkpoint molecules. It is present at low levels in most normal tissues but is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, such as lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Notably, B7H3 overexpression has been found to be associated with a poor prognosis in a broad spectrum of malignant tumors, and it has become an attractive target for cancer therapy in recent years. B7H3-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as DS7300, have shown positive clinical efficacy in small cell lung cancer, squamous non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. GLR1061 is a B7H3 targeting ADC comprised of a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, a cleavable linker and a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. Our independently developed topoisomerase I inhibitor had super strong cancer cell inhibition activity, which was 5 to 10 times stronger than DXd, and enhanced key advantages such as ADC bystander effect. Conjugated with B7-H3 antibody, which had superior binding and internalization, GLR1061 demonstrated more significant anti-tumor efficacy across various cancer types than DS7300 both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, in the CDX model of co-culture of antigen-positive and antigen-negative cells, GLR1061 exhibited much stronger bystander activity than DS7300, which was expected to overcome tumor heterogeneity and effectively eliminate cancer cells with different antigens expressions. In plasma stability studies, GLR1061 showed significantly lower free-payload release than DS7300 in different species (PBS, rat, monkey, and human). In a preclinical repeated-dose toxicology study in mice, GLR1061 showed good tolerability and reversible toxicity. Overall, GLR1061 demonstrated excellent specificity, efficacy, and safety as a next-generation therapy for the treatment of B7H3-positive tumors.Citation Format:Jiao Jiao, Yingjie Sun, Jiaxing Wang, Menghan Cui, Siyao Li, Wenjie Shao, Hairui Yuan, Haitong Sheng.

    "abstract": "Mesothelin (MSLN) is a cell surface molecule that is expressed in its mature form as a 40 kDa protein anchored to the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage. While its expression is limited in normal tissues, MSLN is overexpressed in numerous solid tumors, including ovarian, pancreatic, endometrial, lung and colorectal cancers. Since its discovery, MSLN has been a target of interest for the development of anti-tumor therapeutics across a variety of modalities, including antibodies, CAR-T, and multiple antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). To-date, anti-MSLN ADCs have focused on the delivery of anti-tubulin payloads, including DM4, MMAE, and tubulysin. While these ADCs have had manageable safety profiles in the clinic, efficacy has been modest. Here we present the nonclinical characterization of PF-08052666 (SGN-MesoC2; HBM9033), a first-in-class topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i)-based ADC targeting MSLN. PF-08052666 has been designed to overcome the shortcomings of the previous generation of anti-MSLN ADCs through a novel antibody, differentiated payload, and a higher drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR). PF-08052666 consists of a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a potent camptothecin-based TOP1i payload with a protease cleavable linker at an average DAR of 8. In vitro, PF-08052666 drives direct cytotoxicity through delivery of payload to MSLN-positive cells, bystander killing activity on co-cultured MSLN-negative cells, and retains cytotoxicity in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of soluble MSLN. In vivo, PF-08052666 outperformed a DM4-based anti-MSLN benchmark ADC in cell-line and patient-derived xenograft models across various tumor types, including ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers. PF-08052666 also outperformed the DM4-based anti-MSLN benchmark ADC in heterogenous xenograft models consisting of ad-mixed MSLN-positive and MSLN-negative cells, demonstrating the increased bystander activity of the TOP1i-based payload of PF-08052666. These data support the ongoing first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial of PF-08052666 in patients with advanced solid tumors, which is currently enrolling (NCT06466187).Note: All procedures performed on animals were in accordance with regulations and established guidelines and were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or through an ethical review process.Citation Format:Garrett L.

    "abstract": "Claudin-6 expression is upregulated in ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, endometrial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gastric cancer. ADCT-242 is a novel exatecan based antibody-drug conjugate directed against human Claudin-6. Previous preclinical data demonstrated that ADCT-242 has potent, specific anti-tumor activity in Claudin-6 expressing cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models and exhibited a good tolerability profile up to 40 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys, indicative of a favourable preclinical therapeutic index. Here, we further investigated the anti-tumor activity of ADCT-242 in the OVCAR-3 CDX model, and benchmarked its activity against AB3-7-MMAE, an auristatin-based Claudin-6-targeted ADC. Furthermore, the anti-tumor activity of ADCT-242 in combination with olaparib, bevacizumab or platinum-based drug, such as cisplatin, was investigated in vitro and in vivo in Claudin-6 positive ovarian models. Finally, single agent activity of ADCT-242 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of NSCLC was evaluated. In the OVCAR-3 human ovarian CDX model (H-score 164), ADCT-242 demonstrated dose-dependent anti-tumour activity across the 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg dose range. At 2 mg/kg, 6/8 mice were complete responders (CR), 5 of which were tumor-free survivor (TFS) at the end of the study on Day 42. In this model, a single dose at 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg of ADCT-242 was associated with superior anti-tumor activity when compared to AB3-7-MMAE, dosed QWx3 at 2.5 or 5 mg/kg. In vitro, ADCT-242 in combination with olaparib showed synergistic cytotoxic effects in PA-1 and OVCAR-3 cells (as assessed by the Chou-Talalay method). Anti-tumor activity of ADCT-242 in combination with bevacizumab or platinum-based drug, cisplatin, was also investigated in the OVCAR-3 CDX model in vivo. Finally, in the NSCLC PDX models, ADCT-242 showed strong anti-tumor activity in 3 models. In the LU1144 model (H-Score 231), a single dose of ADCT-242 at 10 mg/kg resulted in 1/4 partial responders at the end of the study on Day 42. In the LU2049 mode (H-Score 255), a single dose of ADCT-242 at 10 mg/kg resulted in 4/5 CR and TFS at the end of the study on Day 42. In the LU11836 mode (H-Score 240), a single dose of ADCT-242 at 10 mg/kg resulted in 3/3 CR and TFS at the end of the study on Day 42. In conclusion, the data presented provide preclinical evidence for superior anti-tumor activity of ADCT-242 vs AB3-7-MMAE in an ovarian CDX model. Furthermore, ADCT-242 was associated with strong anti-tumor activity in NSCLC PDX models, whereas synergistic combination activity with approved drugs such as the PARP inhibitor olaparib, was demonstrated.Citation Format:Nicola Tsang, Elizabeth Horsley, Narinder Janghra, Chris Pickford, Lolke de Haan, Patrick H. van Berkel.

    "abstract": "EGFR is a clinically-validated target that is overexpressed and activated in many human cancers and associated with poor prognosis. However, ADCs targeting EGFR exhibit toxicity due to expression on healthy tissue (1), and EGFR can show heterogeneous tumor expression (2). To engineer a next-generation bispecific EGFR ADC, we utilized InduPro\u2019s proprietary MIntTM platform to identify proteins inherently proximal to EGFR on tumor cells. Among multiple proteins in proximity to EGFR, CDCP1 was identified as a TAPA (tumor associated proximity antigen) of interest. Like EGFR, CDCP1 is over-expressed in multiple cancers and plays key roles in oncogenic signaling and malignant transformation (3). Moreover, EGFR signaling induces upregulation and cell surface localization of CDCP1 as well as inhibition of its palmitoylation-dependent degradation (4).Here we report the development of IDP-001, a novel bispecific ADC targeting EGFR and CDCP1. To identify antibodies that display selective activity only on cells that express both EGFR and CDCP1, we generated antibodies to both targets and then combined them to form over 250 hIgG1-based 1+1 bispecific antibodies with diverse epitopes and affinities. This bispecific library was screened on internalization and cytotoxicity assays, yielding a lead candidate that bound domain III of EGFR with a kappa Fab and bound the membrane-distal domain of CDCP1 with an alpaca-derived VHH. We performed further sequence optimization to affinity tune and humanize this antibody, engineer its Fc, and conjugate it with a DAR of 2 via engineered cysteines to a vcMMAE drug linker to yield our final development candidate, IDP-001.IDP-001 incorporates several design principles that distinguish it from other EGFR ADCs, including possible higher tumor exposure and penetration because of its smaller size. Due to its format and conjugation strategy, IDP-001 exhibits excellent biophysical properties and is highly developable. IDP-001 has potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines with varying target expression levels. IDP-001 is a first-in-class bispecific ADC with the potential for a wider therapeutic window and best-in-class efficacy.References1. Dan-yun Ruan et al., JCO 42 (2024) 6013-6013.2.

    "abstract": "Background:To date, 15 ADCs have been globally approved, 9 of which employ Michael addition reactions between maleimide and the free thiol groups of antibodies. This reaction is characterized by high selectivity, mild conditions, and rapid kinetics. However, the retro-Michael addition reaction in vivo can reverse this process, leading to payload detachment, which compromises the drug\u2019s efficacy and safety. The SuperHydraTM linker promotes maleimide ring-opening via ortho effects, preventing retro-Michael deconjugation and enhancing ADC stability. Consequently, ADCs with the SuperHydraTM linker demonstrate remarkable efficacy, safety, and better stability as represented by our clinical stage candidate, SMP-656, a HER2-eribulin ADC.Methods:SuperHydra\u2122 linkers were designed with varying ortho groups, distances, and pro-hydrolysis group optimizations. A medium hydrolysis-rate linker was chosen for SMP-656 to balance stability during CMC stages with controlled hydrolysis in circulation, ensuring ADC homogeneity. Comparative studies of SMP-656 vs. DS-8201a were performed in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we evaluated SMP-656's cytotoxicity against DS-8201a-induced resistant cells and cells overexpressing the DXd efflux pump. Bystander effects, critical for DS-8201a efficacy, were assessed for SMP-656. Repeat-dose PK and toxicology studies in non-human primates provided PK data and HNSTD.Results:SMP-656 demonstrated significantly higher efficacy than DS-8201a in various cancer cell lines, including DS-8201a-resistant gastric cancer and HER2-low breast cancer cells. It retained potency in resistant models where DS-8201a was ineffective, highlighting its potential for treating resistant and HER2-low patients.In vivo studies showed that SMP-656 achieved higher tumor growth inhibition rates than DS-8201a, with only half the DAR and one-third the dosing amount. This translates to superior tumor inhibition with one-sixth the toxin dosage, highlighting its enhanced safety profile. In NCI-N87 xenografts model, SMP-656 extended tumor inhibition to 62 days at an equivalent payload dose 0.08 mpk (single dose), compared to DS-8201a's 23 days. SMP-656 also demonstrated significant bystander effects, addressing tumor heterogeneity.Repeat-dose PK studies showed high concordance between ADC and total antibody concentration curves, confirming SuperHydraTM linker stability. Additionally, SMP-656 achieved an HNSTD of 10 mpk, representing the highest safety profile among eribulin-based ADCs known to date.Conclusions:The SuperHydraTM linker enabled SMP-656 to combine superior stability, efficacy, and safety with the ability to overcome DS-8201a resistance. SMP-656 represents the safest and most effective eribulin-based ADC and is currently in Phase I clinical trials, showing promising tolerability and efficacy.Citation Format:Jinkun Huang, Chenglong Wu, Chaoyang Feng, Xiaojie Heng, Tingting Yang, Rang Gao, Tianyi Ke.

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) is closely associated with the level of tumor antigen expression and the administered drug dose, as observed in both preclinical and clinical settings. Trop2-targeted ADCs represent a promising therapeutic approach for various solid tumors; however, their efficacy is constrained by the expression levels of Trop2 and the off-tumor, on-target toxicity. To address these limitations, we have developed a bi-specific ADC that targets both Trop2 and B7H4, aiming to increase the overall tumor antigen expression level, and reduce the off-tumor toxicity associated with Trop2 by incorporating a single-arm Trop2 antibody and employing a less toxic Topoi NT3 linker payload in the ADC. Our research has confirmed the co-expression of Trop2 and B7H4 on tumor cells in Triple Negative Breast Cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer, while not on normal mucosal epithelial cells. This co-expression profile supports the use of our bi-specific approach to improve cancer targeting efficiency while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. In vitro studies demonstrate that our bi-specific Trop2/B7H4 ADC (IBI3022) exhibits superior cytotoxicity in HT29 cells overexpressing Trop2 and B7H4 compared to mono-specific ADC benchmarks targeting Trop2 or B7H4. Additionally, IBI3022 shows comparable efficacy to B7H4 ADC in B7H4-positive HCC1569 cells and to Trop2 ADC IBI130 in Trop2-positive BxPC3 and HCC1954 cells. In vivo, IBI3022 demonstrates enhanced tumor suppression compared to mono-specific ADC benchmarks in various tumor models with differing levels of Trop2 and B7H4 expression, including MDA-MB-468, HT29-Trop2-B7H4, HCC1806, JIMT1, and NUGC4. The half-life of IBI3022 in mice is 113 hours, supporting its sustained in vivo efficacy. The developability profile of IBI3022 is favorable, and notably, it is well-tolerated in cynomolgus macaques at doses up to 50 mg/kg. Overall, IBI3022 represents a promising bi-specific ADC for the treatment of gynecologic cancers, offering improved efficacy and safety profiles.Citation Format:Jing Chen, Chenjuan Zhu, Chenchen Zhu, Zhongmin Liu, Min Wu, Weiwei Wu, Junjie Deng, Yi Wang, Xiguang Zhang, Yiming Li.

    "abstract": "c-MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the MET proto-oncogene, is widely expressed in various solid tumors. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) targeting c-Met have shown promising clinical activity in patients with high c-MET expression, yet the therapeutic benefit remains limited for those with moderate or low expression levels. Here, we present the development and preclinical characterization of MHB042C, a next-generation anti-c-Met ADC.Unlike conventional monoclonal antibody (mAb), MHB042C utilizes a humanized VHH targeting c-Met, fused with human IgG1 Fc to deliver the cytotoxic payload. The smaller VHH-Fc fusion protein offers higher potential for tumor tissue penetration compared to traditional mAb. This unique configuration streamlines the conjugation process, achieving a uniform drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4. Additionally, Fc function was silenced to minimize nonspecific ADC uptake. The payload, SuperTopoiTM, a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, was 3 to 5 times more potent than DXd. The linker was designed to enhance hydrophilicity and to resist the retro-Michael reaction, thereby improving plasma stability. In preclinical assays, MHB042C demonstrated stronger cellular binding than competitor antibodies, reaching an internalization rate of approximately 60% in Hs746t cells within one hour. MHB042C exhibited potent cytotoxicity across c-Met-positive cancer cell lines and showed marked antitumor activity in an EBC-1 Squamous NSCLC xenograft model. GLP study in monkeys revealed a favorable safety profile with no off-target toxicities. The highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was determined to be 15 mg/kg Q3W, the maximum dose tested.In conclusion, MHB042C demonstrated potent antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, along with a favorable safety profile, supporting advancement to clinical development.Citation Format:Bo Liu, Liyuan Zhu, Yile Chen, Xiang Meng, Ao Li, Li Liu, Zhili Yao, Yan Wang, Xialian Weng, Xuefeng Zhu, Yang Liu, Shiyu Zhou, Junwei Shi, Guoqing Cao.

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b, FGFR2IIIb), an alternative splicing isoform of FGFR2, is a receptor tyrosine kinases that activates multiple signaling cascades upon binding of FGFs, promoting cancer cell proliferation. It is also a tumor associated antigen overexpressed in multiple solid tumor types, especially gastric cancer (GC). Indeed, the clinical benefit of targeting FGFR2b has been demonstrated by Bemarituzumab, an Fc-enhanced monoclonal antibody in combination with chemotherapy in first-line FGFR2b-expressing gastric cancer. Here, we report the preclinical characterization of BG-C137, a first-in-class FGFR2b antibody conjugated with a topoisomerase inhibitor. In contrast to Bemarituzumab, which functions through antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis/cytotoxicity and sustained signaling blocking function, BG-C137 introduces direct toxin killing to enhance the tumor inhibition with strong bystander effect to overcome the heterogeneity of FGFR2b expression. Upon antigen engagement, BG-C137 was rapidly internalized and potently killed tumor cells with diverse FGFR2b expression level. Single dose of BG-C137 showed strong anti-tumor efficacy in vivo, including FGFR2b-amplified and non-amplified models. It also demonstrated strong bystander killing effect in vitro and maintained strong anti-tumor efficacy in models with heterogeneous FGFR2b expression. Additionally, we showed that corneal dystrophy, which might correlate with corneal toxicity of Bemarituzumab in the clinic, was caused by its complete signaling blocking function. Whereas BG-C137, with weaker blocking function, spared corneal dystrophy in mice as well as in non-human primates, even at high doses. With its differentiated targeting strategy, BG-C137 is not only a first-in-class FGFR2b ADC but also holds the potential to pursue the best-in-class opportunity in FGFR2b targeting treatments. Together, these observations support the clinical development of BG-C137 for the treatment of FGFR2b-expressing tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06625593).Citation Format:Yibin Xu, Xiaolin Su, Qiming Xu, Mengran Qian, Taichang Zhang, Mei-Hsuan Tsai, Ruyue Ji, Junna Jiang, Bin Shao, Yuan Zhuang, Jiyuan Zhang, Xiaomin Song, Zhitao Wan, Xiaoyan Tang, Yue Wu, Charng-Sheng Tsai, Chichi Huang, Lai Wang, Zhirong Shen.

    "abstract": "TROP2 is frequently overexpressed in a number of epithelial cancers, and therapeutics targeting TROP2 has demonstrated clinical efficacy in multiple indications, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), HR+/HER2- breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its broad expression in normal tissues raises the risk of on-target and off-tumor toxicity, potentially limiting the therapeutic effectiveness. PTK7 has emerged as an alternative target, exhibiting high prevalence and overexpression in a variety of tumors, such as TNBC, NSCLC, ovarian, oesophageal and colorectal cancers.BCG033 is a bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets both PTK7 and TROP2, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy while reducing the off-target effects. Developed using Biocytogen\u2019s fully human common light chain RenLite\u00ae mice, BCG033 is conjugated with BLD1102--a novel linker/payload containing a DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitor paired with a highly hydrophilic, protease-cleavable linker, achieving an optimal drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8.Structurally, the backbone of BCG033 consists of a bivalent antibody with two monovalent components that separately target PTK7 and TROP2, which are engineered to minimize internalization and improve tumor selectivity. BCG033 backbone antibody demonstrates strong binding activity under varying PTK7 and TROP2 expression levels in tumors, and exhibits promising developability under stress force degradation.In proof of concept studies, BCG033 AB-vcMMAE showed synergistic effect and enhanced activity compared to the parental ADCs in both cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC, even with low PTK7 expression. When conjugated with Biocytogen\u2019s linker/payload BLD1102, BCG033 demonstrated superior efficacy across varying PTK7 and TROP2 expression levels in PDX models and consistently outperformed benchmark ADCs in multiple tumor models, including NSCLC, TNBC, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer.In summary, BCG033 demonstrates promising potential for delivering potent and broad anti-tumor activity across a range of solid tumors, offering broad clinical application opportunities.Citation Format:Lillian Ma, Na Zhang, Chengzhang Shang, Yi Yang.

    "abstract": "Background:Mesothelin (MSLN) is a cell surface protein in various cancers, including ovarian, pancreatic and malignant mesothelioma. Soluble mesothelin (sMSLN) can be detected in the circulation of patients and may reduce the efficacy of antibody drugs targeting surface MSLN. Acting as a decoy receptor, sMSLN competes for binding or neutralizes the drug, affecting antibody properties. This study examined the anti MSLN antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) RC88, focusing on its ability to target cancer cells and the interference caused by sMSLN, thereby highlighting its competitive advantage over other drugs in clinical studies.Methods:RC88, a novel anti MSLN ADC developed by RemeGen, is in phase I/II trials for advanced solid tumors, either as monotherapy (NCT04175847, NCT06173037) or in combination therapy (NCT05804526). We compared RC88 with other anti MSLN antibodies from relevant trials by antigen and cell binding assays. To show the unique binding of RC88, we treated cellular MSLNs in various conditions to mimic in vivo pathological environments. Additionally, we expressed a truncated MSLN fragment in 293 cells to focus on the C-terminal region near the cell membrane for binding comparisons.Results:Our analysis revealed the distinctive properties of RC88 that may provide clinical advantages. RC88 had a strong primary binding site in the N-terminal domain and a weaker secondary site in the C-terminal region. The primary binding site at amino acids 317-352 was characterized by cross-linking mass spectrometry and mutagenesis. This epitope also facilitates CA125 binding, and RC88 effectively blocks CA125 from binding to MSLN. The secondary binding site located in the C-terminal stem region (amino acids 577-606) was less prominent and appeared to enhance tumor cell binding of RC88. Although further studies are required to refine the location of this secondary site, RC88 demonstrated its ability to bind and induce ADC-mediated cell death in cells expressing the C-terminal fragment of MSLN, a response not seen with other anti MSLN antibodies. When comparing cell binding in the presence of sMSLN, RC88 showed stronger cancer cell binding than others.Conclusions:Our findings show RC88 has unique binding kinetics to different MSLN regions, with a dominant N-terminal binding site by rigorous methods. RC88 displayed superior binding to MSLN-positive cancer cells than other anti MSLN antibodies and maintained effectiveness despite sMSLN interference. Its stronger binding to the C-terminal MSLN fragment compared with other antibodies further underscores its targeting potential in tumor cells. Given its distinctive binding properties, RC88 may bring enhanced clinical benefits for treating MSLN-positive cancers, even with sMSLN and various truncated forms of MSLN in tumor cells. Therefore, RC88 is likely to have greater clinical benefits than other MSLN ADCs in clinical studies.Citation Format:Lili Wang, Yidan Xu, Mingyang Li, Kailin Wang, Xiao Wang, Xiaoping Zhang, Zhanjiao Yu, Yinghao Xin, Chenglin He, Xiangyi He, Xiaoshan Min, Hang Chen, Min Li, Zhulun Wang, Dong Li, Yuanhao Li.

    "abstract": "Background:PCa is the most common cancer among men worldwide. Once patients have progressed to castration resistance, treatment options become scarce, leaving a substantial unmet need in the mCRPC settings. Both B7-H3 and PSMA are tumor-associated antigens that exhibit high levels of expression in PCa, and dual targeting of them with a single agent represents a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of mCRPC. We developed GenSci143, a novel B7-H3\u00d7PSMA-directed bispecific ADC comprised of a bispecific antibody against B7-H3 and PSMA, a highly stable but cleavable linker, and a potent topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload. Potential of GenSci143 as a novel targeted cancer therapy is currently evaluated in preclinical studies.Methods:Membrane expression of B7-H3 and PSMA in tissue microarrays of PCa biopsies was examined by immunohistochemistry analysis. Cell surface levels of B7-H3 and PSMA in PCa cell lines were quantified by flow cytometry using Quantibrite beads. Binding affinity of GenSci143 to B7-H3- and/or PSMA-expressing tumor cells was also determined using flow cytometry. To assess internalization, cells were treated with pHrodoTM-labelled antibodies, and fluorescence intensity was recorded. In vitro cytotoxic effect of GenSci143 on PCa cell lines was evaluated using a Luminescent Cell Viability assay. In vivo anti-tumor activity of GenSci143 was assessed in CDX models of PCa and compared to that of the DS-7300 and ARX517 analogs.Results:B7-H3 and PSMA were highly co-expressed in PCa tissues (N=102), lending strong support to our dual-targeting therapeutic approach for mCRPC. GenSci143 showed strong in vitro binding, internalization, and cytotoxicity in tumor cells expressing either B7-H3 or PSMA or both TAAs. In human CDX models of PCa in mice, GenSci143 effectively induced tumor regression across different expression levels of B7-H3 and PSMA and demonstrated superior anti-tumor efficacy versus the DS-7300 and ARX517 analogs. Moreover, GenSci143 showed much better in vitro plasma stability than DS-7300. Following intravenous injection at 10 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys, GenSci143 exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, with serum concentration of free payload lower than 1.0 ng/mL at any time examined. In a pilot non-GLP repeat dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, GenSci143 was well tolerated, demonstrating a significantly higher therapeutic index than DS-7300 based on PK-PD modeling and simulation.Conclusion:These results suggest that GenSci143 has the potential to become an effective therapeutic option for mCRPC patients and support its further evaluation in IND-enabling studies.Citation Format:Yao Xu, Fu Li, Zhiyu Cui, Hongmei Xie, Wei Yan, Yan Li, Weiming He, Wenqiang Zhai, Fanglong Yang, John L.

    "abstract": "There is a critical need to safely enhance the potency of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for targeting low-expression and heterogeneous tumors, as well as to overcome drug resistance and relapse. Cancer cells often develop resistance to single-agent therapies, making it essential to explore combination approaches. One promising strategy presented in this work is combining two payloads with different mechanisms of action (MOA) into a single ADC, creating dual-payload ADCs. Clinical data have shown that if resistance develops to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (Topo1i) ADC, it will also result in resistance to a Topo1i ADC administered sequentially, regardless of the target antigen. This implies that anti-tumor activity of Topo1 ADCs is limited by formation of resistance towards the payload (cross-payload resistance). In contrast, switching to a payload with different MOAs, such as transitioning from Topo1i to microtubule inhibitor or vice versa, can help to restore the effectiveness of ADCs. The combination study of sacituzumab govitecan and enfortumab vedotin has clinically validated the concept of concomitant administration of a Topo1i payload with a microtubule inhibitor (MTi) payload to increase response rates without significantly increasing toxicity. Dual-payload ADCs that combine Topo1i and MTi agents are specifically designed to maximize their anti-tumor activity by overcoming resistance and broadening the therapeutic potential. Another promising dual-payload strategy involves combining PARP inhibitors (PARPi) with Topo1i, as PARP plays a critical role in repairing DNA damage induced by Topo1i. Such a Topo1i/PARPi dual-payload ADC has the potential to improve anti-tumor activity while avoiding toxicities commonly associated with conventional PARPi chemotherapy, due to the lack of targeted delivery. By leveraging Sutro\u2019s cell-free expression platform and its precise dual conjugation technology, we fine-tuned the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and dual payload ratios to achieve optimal synergy between the two MOAs. The homogeneous, dual-payload ADCs demonstrate desirable physicochemical properties, enabled by the careful selection of conjugation sites and a best-in-class hydrophilic \u03b2-glucuronide linker. These design features also resulted in favorable pharmacokinetics and stability of dual-payload ADCs. Using this approach, we identified superior anti-tumor activities against low-antigen and Topo1 ADC-resistant tumor models treated with dual-payload ADCs compared to mono-payload ADCs. Furthermore, the dual payload approach streamlines preclinical, clinical development and the manufacturing process compared to the parallel development of two mono-payload ADCs.Citation Format:Gang Yin, Daniel Calarese, Alice Yam, Werner Rubas, Krishna Bajjuri, Xiaofan Li, Helena Kiefei, Miao Wen, Guifen Xu, Abigail Yu, Hans-Peter Gerber.

    "abstract": "PDL1V is a novel vedotin antibody drug-conjugate (ADC) currently in Phase I clinical development for advanced solid tumors as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab (NCT05208762). The primary mechanism of action (MOA) of PDL1V is direct cytotoxicity to PD-L1-expressing tumor cells via the intracellular delivery of MMAE. While PD-L1 is an established checkpoint protein, pharmacokinetic data suggest steric checkpoint inhibition by PDL1V may be limited by the dose and schedule being evaluated in the clinic. Here, we characterized additional antitumor MOAs of PDL1V, including bystander killing and immunogenic cell death (ICD), and evaluated the effects of PDL1V on immune cells.PDL1V is potently cytotoxic to a variety of PD-L1-positive cancer cell lines in vitro. Using a flow cytometry-based viability assay, we showed that PDL1V also drives dose-dependent bystander effect-based cytotoxicity of PD-L1-negative tumor cells when co-cultured with PD-L1-positive tumor cells. ICD, a regulated activation of immune cell recruitment to the TME, is caused by tumor cell release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as cell surface chaperone calreticulin (CRT), extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP), and High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1). PD-L1-positive cancer cells treated with PDL1V in vitro released all three DAMPs, suggesting that targeted delivery of the MMAE payload drives induction of ICD.As an immune checkpoint protein, PD-L1 is expressed on antigen presenting cells and T cells. Depletion of these cells could affect the tolerability of PDL1V as a monotherapy, or limit efficacy in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies. To investigate the potential for immune cell depletion, macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells were evaluated in an in vitro fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay. PDL1V had minimal cytotoxic activity across all three cell-types, despite expression of PD-L1. These data support PDL1V as selectively cytotoxic to PD-L1-positive and negative cancer cells of the tumor microenvironment, and not cytotoxic to PD-L1-positive immune cells involved in natural antitumor immunity. Since T cell-driven antitumor immunity is a key driver for the efficacy of PD-(L)1 blockade, these data suggest PDL1V is a promising combination partner with anti-PD-1 immunotherapies such as pembrolizumab. Future studies will evaluate the effects of PDL1V on immunosuppressive cells, including regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, and the pharmacodynamic effects of PDL1V in syngeneic mouse xenograft models.Ethics Approval: All procedures performed on animals were in accordance with regulations and established guidelines and were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or through an ethical review process.Citation Format:Megan Atkins Ramirez, Midori Clarke, Steven Jin, Ellie Moskovitz, Andres Forero-Torres, Garrett Cornelison.

The LD038 linker-payload leverages exatecan\u2019s ability to stabilize Topo I-DNA complexes and induce DNA damage and cell death. We tested TD001 in 2D and 3D cell cultures and in vivo in human CRPC xenograft models with different levels of PSMA expression. We evaluated cell internalization, payload release, and drug activity by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Free payload levels were measured 24 h post treatment in plasma and tumors by LC-MS/MS. TD001 showed efficient binding and rapid internalization within 1-3 h followed by lysosomal localization and payload release in PSMA-expressing cells. Due to the quick and effective payload release, TD001 exhibited selective and potent activity with the induction of Topo I-mediated DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3). TD001 had no effect on PSMA-negative cells. This was supported by 3D cell culture models, which demonstrated rapid diffusion into the extracellular matrix, and rapid internalization of TD001 into PSMA-expressing tumor cells. TD001 was evaluated in vivo in three CRPC xenograft models with different PSMA expression patterns: the high/homogenous (\u223c104 ligands/cell) PSMA-expressing LNCaP-abl cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) castrated mouse model, the intermediate/heterogeneous (\u223c102-104 ligands/cell) PSMA-expressing 22Rv1 CDX castrated mouse model, and the AR-positive, high/homogenous (\u223c105 ligands/cell)-PSMA-expressing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) C5 mouse model. The LD038 linker-payload in TD001 resulted in high free payload release within tumor tissue, triggering DNA damage, cell death, and growth arrest. Notably, tumor uptake and a very high tumor/plasma ratio (70-100 fold) of exatecan were similar 24 h after IV administration in all three in vivo models despite substantial differences in PSMA expression and heterogeneity. These findings highlight the ability of TD001 to deliver effectively and selectively the payload exatecan to PSMA-positive prostate tumors, resulting in potent antitumor activity in different CRPC models, including those with intermediate and heterogenous PSMA expression.Citation Format:Daniela Impellizzieri, Elisa Storelli, Atik Balla, Simone Mosole, Cristina Dongilli, Federico Jauk, Roberta Frapolli, Lavinia Morosi, Maurizio D'Incalci, Jemila Houacine, Morris Rosenberg, B\u00e9rang\u00e8re Deleglise, Esteban Cvitkovic, Carlo V.

    "abstract": "Elevated expression of folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1) in various cancers, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), highlights FR\u03b1 as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutics to treat FR\u03b1-expressing tumor types. AZD5335, an FR\u03b1-targeting antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) payload, is currently being investigated in the FONTANA Phase I/IIa clinical trial (NCT#05797168), either as a single agent or in combination with a PARP1-selective inhibitor (saruparib). Using an FR\u03b1-expressing EOC xenograft model (OV90), we evaluate additional AZD5335-relevant combined treatment strategies and report pre-clinical assessment of AZD5335 in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and/or carboplatin. Compared to monotherapy treatment, we successfully demonstrate that combination treatments with AZD5335+bevacizumab, AZD5335+paclitaxel or AZD5335+carboplatin result in significant and durable anti-tumor responses. Using the same EOC xenograft model, we extended these studies to include AZD5335+bevacizumab plus either paclitaxel or carboplatin treatments and demonstrated that these triplet combos resulted in superior and durable anti-tumor activities. Combination data in a number of additional CDX/PDX will be presented. A series of in vitro studies will also define the ADC/SOC drug interactions and further delineate underlying mechanisms driving enhanced efficacy. These studies inform our ongoing clinical development of AZD5335 in ovarian cancer.Citation Format:Jason J.

    "abstract": "Cadherin-17 (CDH17) is a membranous cell adhesion protein predominantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. High CDH17 expression is associated with metastatic progression in different cancers that mainly originate from gastrointestinal tracts. YL217 is a novel CDH17 -targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and built on MediLink\u2019s TMALIN\u00ae platform, which can release the payload both in the tumor cell and in the tumor microenvironment. This study evaluated efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of YL217 in non-clinical studies. YL217 could specifically bind to CDH17 on tumor cell surfaces, followed with payload release both in the lysosome through internalization and in the tumor microenvironment. These translate in vivo where YL217 showed superior efficacy in causing tumor regressions and good tolerability in both cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (CDX and PDX) mouse models with low to high CDH17 expression levels. The in vivo pharmacokinetics in monkeys showed that YL217 is highly stable with less than 0.1% (molar ratio) payload released in circulation. These non-clinical data suggest the high stability of the linker in circulation as well as efficient payload release in tumors. Moreover, acceptable safety profiles were also noted in monkey GLP toxicity studies. Taken together, preclinical data suggest that YL217 could be further developed in the treatment of CDH17-positive cancer patients.Citation Format:Wei Lian, Qing Zong, Chun Deng, Peng Zou, Liang Xiao, Tongtong Xue, Jiaqiang Cai.

    "abstract": "B7-H4, a member of B7 family, is a transmembrane protein that inhibits T cell immunity. It is overexpressed in various malignancies, including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, as well as cholangiocarcinoma, where it has been associated with tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) targeting B7-H4 have demonstrated promising clinical activity. Here, we present the development and preclinical characterization of MHB009C, a novel B7-H4 ADC.MHB009C comprises a human IgG1 antibody against B7-H4, conjugated to the SuperTopoiTM payload, a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor that is 3\u223c5 times more potent than DXd, with a drug-antibody ratio of \u223c4.0. Fc function was silenced to minimize nonspecific ADC uptake, and the linker was designed to enhance hydrophilicity and prevent the retro-Michael reaction, improving plasma stability. MHB009C demonstrated strong binding affinity to B7-H4 and was efficiently internalized by SK-BR-3 cells. It exhibited potent cytotoxicity in B7-H4-positive breast cancer cell lines and showed significant antitumor activity in an MX-1 breast cancer xenograft model. GLP study in monkeys revealed a favorable safety profile with no off-target toxicities, and the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was determined to be 30 mg/kg Q3W, the maximum dose tested.In conclusion, MHB009C demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, along with a favorable safety profile, supporting further clinical development.Citation Format:Liyuan Zhu, Bo Liu, Yile Chen, Xiang Meng, Ao Li, Li Liu, Zhili Yao, Yan Wang, Xialian Weng, Xuefeng Zhu, Yang Liu, Shiyu Zhou, Junwei Shi, Guoqing Cao.

    "abstract": "Introduction:FGFR2b is a novel protein biomarker detected by IHC with the overexpression rate of \u223c30% (any 2+/3+) in gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer(GC/GEJC) patients, and among those patients \u223c40% are not eligible for currently approved targeted therapies (HER2, PD-L1, MMR and CLDN18.2)1. HDM2020 is a topoisomerase Inhibitor based DAR8 ADC developed using a novel Ab targeted against FGFR2b, which has the potential to treat FGFR2b overexpressing tumor with reasonable safety window2.Methods: In vivo cell line (CDX) and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models were conducted to validate the therapeutic potential of HDM2020 against GC and sq-NSCLC. FGFR2b expression were detected by IHC using various tumor paraffin sections.Results: Combination of HDM2020 and avastin or paclitaxel demonstrated a synergistic effect in GC CDX model. Single-agent therapeutic activity of HDM2020 was demonstrated in two FGFR2b-positive GC PDX models with TP53 or BCOR gene mutation and at least 1st line chemotherapy. At a dose of 10mg/kg, the maximum tumor growth inhibition rate were 98% and 99%. In FGFR2b middle expressed sq-NSCLC PDX model, complete response was observed at single dose of 10mg/kg. The minimum effective doses were between 2.5-3mg/kg in above three models. FGFR2b is overexpressed in GC, sq-NSCLC, TNBC and may other tumor types. Conclusion: Based on the clinical validation of FGFR2b in GC and signs of early preclinical activity in sq-NSCLC with significant unmet need, HDM2020 might has promising efficacy in these indications. HDM2020 is expected to enter clinical development in 2025.References:1: Seiya Sato, Shannon L Rhodes, et al.

    "abstract": "CLDN18.2 is a promising target for GI cancer therapy, with various modalities under clinical evaluation. However, these therapies face challenges due to the heterogeneous expression of CLDN18.2, leading to inconsistent efficacy and the need of patient stratification, as observed with Zolbetuximab, AZD0901 and IBI343. Besides, these treatments may induce drug resistance by downregulating CLDN18.2. Recently, CDH17 (Cadherin 17) has emerged as a novel target for biologics, often overexpressed in GI cancers. But in normal tissues, it remains inaccessible as it is hidden within the tight junctions of intestinal epithelial cells, which makes it a favorable target for cancer therapy. More importantly, systematic analysis of expression data reveals high co-expression or complementary expression of CDH17 with CLDN18.2 in GI cancers, with no co-expression in other major organs. This discovery presents an opportunity for a bispecific anti-CDH17/CLDN18.2 therapy, potentially addressing the limitation of targeting CLDN18.2 alone. VBC108 is a bispecific ADC designed to target both CDH17 and CLDN18.2 with TOPO1i payload. The unique design maximizes efficacy while minimizing safety risks. VBC108 distinguishes itself from other CLDN18.2-targeting therapies through the following features. VBC108 targets both CDH17 and CLDN18.2, potentially overcoming tumor heterogeneity and covering over 80% of gastric and 50% of pancreatic cancers without CLDN18.2 IHC selection. It has high affinity to CDH17 and CLDN18.2, enhanced binding avidity, internalization and cytotoxicity. Moreover, it has a strong bystander effect to help further overcome the heterogeneity of tumor antigen expression. In CDH17 single-positive CDX models, which represent clinical scenarios lacking targeted therapies, VBC108 exhibited strong efficacy, whereas AZD0901 did not inhibit tumor growth at all. In CDH17/CLDN18.2 double-positive CDX models, representing clinical scenarios with target expression heterogeneity, VBC108 further showed its superiority. In CLDN18.2 single-positive CDX models, reflecting clinical scenarios with available CLDN18.2-targeted therapies, VBC108 demonstrated comparable efficacy with different payload mechanisms. In the PDX (GC, PADC, CRC) studies, especially in the GC model with low to medium expression of CDH17/CLDN18.2, it achieved a 100% CR. Furthermore, preliminary toxicity studies in Cyno-monkeys showed good tolerability with repeated doses. VBC108 also exhibited excellent developability in a comprehensive developability assessment (DA) test, making it a strong candidate for further CMC development. In summary, VBC108, with its unique design, shows the potential as a first-in-class ADC for GI cancer and supports the advancement to clinical trials.Citation Format:Wei (Vivian) Wang, Lingyu Guan, Man Xu, Qun Yin, Chen Dong, Jing Li.

    "abstract": "Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), a non-classical MHC class I molecule, is expressed only in the placenta, where it functions as an immune suppressor to protect the fetus from maternal immune recognition. Recent studies have demonstrated that HLA-G is enriched in various malignant cells, providing evidence that HLA-G is strongly associated with tumor immune escape. HLA-G, a tumor-specific antigen, mediates immune suppression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages, by engaging inhibitory receptors such as Ig-like transcript 2 (ILT2) and 4 (ILT4). Therefore, the development of an HLA-G-targeting ADC can be a novel therapeutic strategy not only to induce direct tumor cell killing through payload delivery upon binding to HLA-G, but also to take advantage of the fact that HLA-G is minimally expressed on normal cells and predominantly restricted to tumor cells. This selective expression pattern makes HLA-G a promising target compared to other cancer antigens, in which off-target effects on normal tissues are expected to be minimal. Moreover, by disrupting the interaction between HLA-G and inhibitory receptors such as ILT2, this approach enhances anti-tumor immunity, followed by boosting immune activation and improving therapeutic outcomes. We developed an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting HLA-G (IMB-201) to selectively deliver cytotoxic drugs to HLA-G-expressing tumor cells, thereby overcoming immune suppression and promoting tumor regression. We generated a monoclonal antibody specific to HLA-G and conjugated it with a potent cytotoxic drug via a stable linker. The IMB-201 demonstrated high binding affinity and selectivity for HLA-G-positive tumor cells. In vitro serum and preliminary stability assays confirmed that the stability of IMB-201 is comparable to that of other developed ADCs. In vitro studies revealed significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity when treated to HLA-G-expressing cell lines, with minimal off-target effects on HLA-G-negative cells. In vivo studies employing mouse models demonstrated significant tumor regression and prolonged survival. Collectively, the IMB-201 could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of HLA-G-positive solid tumors, such as gastric and pancreatic cancers. As HLA-G is a tumor-specific antigen, it has the potential to widen the therapeutic index (TI) compared to other conventional therapies. This strategy selectively targets tumor cells, delivering cytotoxic agents and enhancing immune response, thereby overcoming immune evasion mechanisms.Citation Format:Hyeonju Kang, Inyoung Lee, Joseph Kim, Yoojin Kim, Sungmuk Kang, Yongjun Kang, Hongjai Lee, Chungmin Lee, Chihye Park, Gyongsik Ha.

    "abstract": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein folate receptor, is highly expressed in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and expression increases following androgen deprivation therapy. TD001 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a deimmunized anti-PSMA IgG1 monoclonal antibody (HuJ591), conjugated to a highly stable, protease-cleavable proprietary Topo I inhibitor exatecan linker-payload (LD038), with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. Free payload and total ADC were evaluated in mouse plasma, tumor, and liver, after TD001 10 mg/kg IV (which has potent antitumor activity in vivo) in 2 human CRPC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models, LNCaP-abl (high PSMA expression \u223c104 ligands/cell) and 22Rv1 (intermediate/heterogeneous PSMA \u223c102-104 ligands/cell) in castrated NRG/NSG mice. The TD001 PK profile was characterized across a wide temporal span post treatment, in LNCaP-abl (5 min to 10 days) and 22Rv1 (2 h to 6 days). The PK/PD profile of a range of doses (3-20 mg/kg) was characterized in both models. Dose proportional free exatecan concentrations were observed in tumor and plasma, and a consistently high tumor/plasma (T/P) ratio (\u223c70-100 fold) was seen in both tumor models across the range of TD001 doses tested. Potent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was dose dependent up to 20 mg/kg. PK/PD and the high therapeutic index with different dosing schedules are presented separately. Free exatecan was detected in tumors 5 min post treatment in LNCaP-abl. Free exatecan concentrations were approximately 80x higher in tumor compared to plasma 2 h post treatment, and at least 100x higher from 6 h to 6 days post treatment, showing rapid and high distribution of TD001 to the targeted tumor tissue regardless of PSMA expression levels. The concentration of total ADC (assuming constant DAR 8) was \u223c200 \u00b5g/mL (5 min post treatment), remained high for up to 6 days post treatment, while decreasing gradually from 24 h allowing for prolonged tumor exposure to TD001. The high and prolonged T/P ratio supports the excellent therapeutic index observed in TGI studies in both CDX castrated mice models, with TGI >90% and good tolerance (described separately). Of note, exatecan plasma levels rapidly declined under 0.5 ng/mL (from 24 h) and were under the limit of quantification (0.1 ng/mL) 10 days post treatment, preventing systemic toxicity. No free exatecan accumulation was observed after repeat dosing (described separately). TD001 effectively and preferentially delivers the potent exatecan payload to tumor tissue, with minimal systemic exposure, contributing to an excellent therapeutic index and strong antitumor activity in multiple CRPC models with high or intermediate PSMA expression. Our preclinical PK data support clinical development of TD001 in PSMA-expressing CRPC patients.Citation Format:Lavinia Morosi, Daniela Impellizzieri, Roberta Frapolli, Elisa Storelli, Atik Balla, Carlo V.

    "abstract": "Background:Nectin-4 is a tumor-associated antigen, which was observed in multiple cancer types, including bladder, breast, lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Enfortumab Vedotin (EV) is the first approved nectin-4 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with MMAE as its payload for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, beyond UC, EV hasn\u2019t been approved for other indications. In addition, severe skin adverse reactions were reported in EV-treated patients. There are several new nectin-4 ADCs in development but haven\u2019t entered confirmative clinical studies so far. To overcome the limitations of efficacy and safety, we developed a novel mechanism nectin-4 ADC GLR1059, with a payload that was more effective for potential indications with nectin-4 expression and had lower toxicity, including skin adverse reactions.Methods:For in vitro studies, binding affinity and specificity, internalization, cancer cell killing, bystander effect and serum stability were performed. For in vivo studies, efficacy studies were conducted on cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) of multiple cancer types, e.g. breast cancer (including triple-negative breast cancer), and urothelial carcinoma. Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties were studied in BALB/c mice and tumor-bearing nude mice, and safety studies were conducted in humanized nectin-4 mice.Results:GLR1059 is a nectin-4 ADC composed of a novel humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, a cleavable linker and a microtubule targeting agent (not auristatin derivatives). Moreover, to generate DAR4 ADCs with higher homogeneity, the payload was site-specifically conjugated to the antibody via a disulfide bond bridge. In surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, GLR1059 had strong and specific binding to human nectin-4, and it did not bind to nectin-1, nectin-2, or nectin-3. Furthermore, GLR1059 exhibited efficient internalization and potent activity in nectin-4 expressing cell lines and effective bystander activity. In a panel of CDX models, GLR1059 demonstrated compelling anti-tumor activity across bladder cancer and breast cancer (including TNBC), with tumor growth inhibition rates (TGI) significantly higher than EV (approximately 2-4 times). In the tumor-bearing mice PK study, the Cmax of free payload in tumor tissue was approximately 100-fold higher than that in the blood (131\u00b114ng/g vs 1.04\u00b10.27ng/mL). GLR1059 demonstrated longer survival and less weight loss in the single- and repeated-dose toxicity studies in humanized nectin-4 mice. Notably, GLR1059 significantly reduced the incidence and severity of skin toxicity compared with EV (1/6 vs 6/6).Conclusion:Preclinical data show that GLR1059 has the potential to achieve better efficacy and safety, and the different drug mechanisms provide new options to overcome drug resistance of current nectin-4 ADCs.Citation Format:Jiao Jiao, Yingjie Sun, Jiaxing Wang, Liming Che, Menghan Cui, Wenjie Shao, Hairui Yuan, Yan Huang, Nannan Zhai, Yuling Tang, Xiaomei Zheng, Siyao Li.

    "abstract": "Background:Transmembrane-4-L-six-family member-1 (TM4SF1) is a tetraspanin superfamily member that is overexpressed in cancers such as breast, colon, lung, liver, and prostate. A contributor to tumor development and progression, TM4SF1 participates in microdomains that regulate cancer cell migration and invasion via induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. The overexpression of TM4SF1 makes it an attractive target for the developing novel treatments of GI tract cancers.Methods and Results:We have engineered an anti-TM4SF1 antibody that binds with nM affinity to TM4SF1-expressing cells. The mAb has anti-tumor growth inhibition in gastric, ovarian cancer cell lines. This mAb can serve as an efficacious targeting carrier for toxins in an ADC and for siRNA in an ARC. To broaden the scope of cancer cell engagement, we prepared constructed a TM4SF1-cMET bispecific ADC which showed potent cytotoxicity in multiple GI, lung, ovarian, breast, TNBC, and pancreatic cancer cell lines in in vitro cell cytotoxicity assays. The bispecific TM4SF1-cMET MMAE (DAR=4) treatment led to potent tumor growth inhibition (70% to 95% TGI) in CDX pancreatic and gastric cancer xenograft models. The mice in the TM4SF1-cMET MMAE treatment group maintained normal body weight throughout the treatment course without observed toxicity. The TM4SF1 - MYC siRNA conjugates were stable. Treatment of MYC-dependent cancer lines led to MYC protein knockdown and cell growth inhibition.Conclusions:A bispecific TM4SF1 ADC had activity in multiple cancer cell lines. Notably, the TM4SF1-MMAE molecule showed potent in vivo tumor growth inhibition in ovarian, pancreatic, and gastric cell lines. The TM4SF1 - siRNA ARC had tumor cell proliferation inhibition in lung, pancreatic, and gastric cancer cell lines. Preclinical safety assessment, pharmacokinetics and IND-enabling studies are on-going with the goal of developing TM4SF1 as the \u201cbest-in-class\u201d ADC molecule for the treatment of lung, gastric, breast, and pancreatic cancers with significant unmet medical needs. This antibody can be applied to alternative targeting modalities.Citation Format:Mingquan Xie, Peter Li, Han Lu, ShuTing Dong, Nicole Wilski, Poonam Pandey, Nishida Motohiko, Peter Haytko, Mark Chiu, Maria P.

    "abstract": "Background:The integrins are a family of cell surface receptors existing as heterodimers formed with one \u03b1 subunit and one \u03b2 subunit, and there are 24 heterodimers identified so far. These receptors play diverse roles in cellular adhesion, motility, and cytokinesis. Integrin \u03b24 (ITGB4), also known as CD104, binds to integrin \u03b16 (ITGA6) to form \u03b16\u03b24 integrin heterodimer that is recognized as a ligand of laminin and plays a critical role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin. The cytoplasmic tail of ITGB4 contains approximately 1000 amino acids which is longer than any other integrin \u03b2 subunit. ITGB4 interacts with and plays important roles in multiple tumor-promoting signaling pathways including ErbB2, PI3K, FAK/AKT, and c-MET, and has been frequently reported as a potential prognostic and predictive marker in various cancers.Methods& Results: Utilizing our proprietary AI-based target identification platform, ITGB4 was identified as a promising therapeutic target for multiple malignancies. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining confirmed high ITGB4 expression in tumor tissues from patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). CS5006, an ITGB4-targeted ADC, comprises a humanized anti-ITGB4 antibody, a proprietary CSL linker, and the well-validated topoisomerase 1 inhibitor exatecan (EXd). The plasma-stable, hydrophilic, beta-glucuronide CSL linker enables effectively tumor-selective toxin release. Both CS5006 and the humanized ITGB4-targeted antibody H86.2 exhibited selective binding to ITGB4 with high affinity, and triggered rapid, high-level internalization. In vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrated CS5006\u2019s potent, target-dependent killing of ITGB4-expressing tumor cell lines. CS5006 also showed robust in vivo antitumor activity in CDX models originated from multiple cancer types, with minimal effective dose (MED) of 5 mg/kg. Pilot toxicity studies in non-human primate demonstrated a favorable safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of CS5006.Conclusion:CS5006 is a novel ITGB4-targeted ADC with robust preclinical efficacy and a favorable safety and PK profile. These findings support further IND-enabling and clinical evaluation of CS5006 as a promising ADC therapy for various advanced solid tumors.Citation Format:Chuan Wang, Yamin Wang, Xinling Zhang, Ning Zhang, Yilin Huo, Yongwang Li, Xuelian Liu, Mengyao Zhu, Jingyu Sun, Yongli Yang, Yuxin Qian, Xueqin Dai, Fei Ma, Yi Sun, Jianxin Yang.

    "abstract": "Background:The HGF/cMET signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and other normal physiological functions. cMET is expressed in many different normal tissues but is usually expressed at low levels. Abnormal expression and dysfunction of cMET have been found in a variety of tumors. cMET is a well-established target in clinical, but its clinical application is limited, because clinical efficacy was mainly observed in cMET signaling driving tumor or cMET-high expression tumors. To extend the potential therapeutic population and anti-tumor activity, we searching for some new approaches, such as bispecific antibody drug conjugates. Bioinformatics analysis and translational research showed that cMET and B7H3 are co-expressed in multiple types of solid tumors without high expression in normal tissues. Therefore, targeting both B7H3 and cMET could be a new and powerful strategy in pan-tumor therapy.Methods& Results: We developed a novel B7H3xcMET targeted bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) called SCR-A0011, which is comprised of B7H3/cMET bispecific antibody conjugated with novel topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (CPT116). SCR-A0011 specifically bind B7H3 and cMET with high affinity, and showed enhanced internalization and binding capacity compared to parental monoclonal antibody ADC separately in the B7H3/cMET co-expressing cell line. SCR-A0011 induced tumor cell lysis in various tumor cell types including NSCLC, CRC, OC, HNSCC, etc. SCR-A0011 showed remarkable anti-tumor efficacy in several CDX models in a dose dependent manner. SCR-A0011 exhibits significantly stronger anti-tumor activity than their parental monoclonal-ADC or clinical ADC in B7H3+cMET+ double positive tumor cells. SCR-A0011 also have very good stability and favorable developability.Conclusion:These findings illustrated SCR-A011 could be a potential First-in-Class BsADC to conquer the resistance or non-response of current treatment in broad cancer types and may provide a new therapeutic approach for B7H3 and cMET positive cancer patients in the future.Citation Format:Yayuan Fu, Guangcun Cheng, Hui Zheng, Shuai Wang, Lei Jiang, Chunlei Xia, Huipeng Guo, Xiyuan Wang, Renhong Tang.

    "abstract": "HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor critical for cell growth and differentiation. As a pivotal therapeutic target, HER2 has been extensively investigated in ADC drug development, resulting in numerous innovative designs along with approval in recent years. Among these, dual-payload ADCs, particularly those utilizing small molecules with distinct mechanisms of action, represent a promising yet still evolving area of research. DXC018 is a novel HER2-targeting bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) featuring dual epitope binding and dual payload delivery. The bispecific feature of DXC018 to bind HER2 domains II and IV with high affinity, enables its target specificity and therapeutic efficacy. Its payload, comprising an antimetabolite inhibitor and a topoisomerase I inhibitor, effectively induces DNA damage and cytotoxic effects. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice revealed favorable properties, with overlapping pharmacokinetic profiles for the ADC and total antibody, indicating excellent linker stability. Toxicological evaluations confirmed its tolerability at doses up to 300 mg/kg. In xenograft models of human cancer cells, including NCI-N87, JIMT-1, and CFPAC-1 cells, DXC018 exhibited superior or comparable antitumor activity to Dxd conjugate at equivalent doses. These findings suggest that DXC018, by leveraging dual HER2 binding and the complementary mechanisms of the antimetabolite and the topoisomerase I inhibition, offers significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of gastrointestinal malignancies and the other solid tumors.

    "abstract": "Background:AMB304 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) combining a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody and a high efficacious topoisomerase I inhibitor (Topo I) payload with site-specific conjugation. The target of AMB304 is a cell surface expressed glycoprotein, elevated in a range of tumors, and is associated with cancer survival, growth, metastasis, drug resistance and poor prognosis. This target is highly expressed in various epithelial cancers, including triple negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, advanced malignancies with limited treatment options also demonstrate high target expression, suggesting that AMB304 may provide potential clinical benefits. Furthermore, elevated expression of the target is associated with resistance to anti-tumor drugs, such as EGFR TKIs (e.g., Gefitinib) and trastuzumab, via signaling. In this study, we investigated the cancer-specific therapeutic potential of AMB304, focusing on its preclinical characterization, including anti-cancer efficacy and safety profile.Methods:Various types of tumor cell lines were treated with AMB304 using tumor spheroid model. For in vivo efficacy study, cancer cell lines or patients derived cells were inoculated subcutaneously in mice xenograft models. Target expression intensity in each tumor model was identified through immunohistochemistry (IHC). The toxicity profiles of AMB304 were analyzed, and its pharmacokinetics were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys.Results:AMB304 exhibited robust potency against target-expressing cancer cell lines, as evidenced by cell viability assay and compelling efficacy in various xenograft models, with IHC confirming its tumor regression depends on target expression. It exhibited target-specific binding, efficient internalization, and a strong bystander killing effect. In cynomolgus monkeys, AMB304 was well- tolerated with no significant adverse events at tolerable doses. Its stable linker chemistry minimized payload release, and it showed favorable pharmacokinetics, supporting its clinical potential.Conclusion:This study demonstrates that AMB304 is potent ADC with significant anticancer efficacy and an excellent safety profile. Moreover, its superior stability in plasma enhances its potential for clinical treatment. Therefore, AMB304 could be developed as a targeted therapy for advanced solid tumors with high target expression.Citation Format:Do-Hyun Nam, Yeong-Woo Kim, Byeongkwi Min, Wonsik Jung, Eunsuk Choi, Jungsu Shin, Nam-Gu Her.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent an innovative approach in targeted cancer therapy, combining antibodies' specificity with therapeutic modalities such as cytotoxic or targeted chemical compounds. This study presents an ADC testing platform, leveraging patient-derived organoids (PDO) and advanced 3D high-content imaging.Methods:The efficacy of FDA-approved ADC Sacituzumab Govitecan/SN38 (SG), was evaluated in the CellTiter-Glo (CTG)-based OrganoidXplore panel, a 3D in vitro screening panel of 50 organoid models across 7 indications. The panel was characterized by NGS (WES, RNAseq) but selected without bias for TROP2/TACSTD2 expression. The OrganoidXplore screen was followed up with validating SG and payload responses using CTG and high-content imaging (HCI). ADC target engagement was assessed via immunofluorescence (IF) and ADC responses were validated in a selection of in vivo PDX models.Results:SG demonstrated a broad differential response (<0.01nM<IC50<50nM) in the OrganoidXplore panel, with 18 models showing strong responses (IC50<0.01nM). Response rates did not correlate with mRNA expression TROP2/TACSTD2. IF staining of the original PDX tumor tissues and organoids confirmed the correspondence between TROP2/TACSTD2 mRNA and protein expression levels, reaffirming that SG sensitivity did not directly correlate with gene and protein expression. Additional studies were performed with SG and SN38 in selected resistant and sensitive organoid models by HCI analysis. Similarly to the CTG assay, TROP2/TACSTD2 protein expression did not correlate with increased SG efficacy, showing that PDO sensitivity was not primarily driven by absolute target levels but rather through the mode of action of ADC uptake and payload sensitivity. Preliminary in vivo ADC efficacy results supported the in vitro findings.Conclusion:The OrganoidXplore screening platform provides insights into ADC efficacy, and responses and target engagement were validated with HCI. Combined, this demonstrates a lack of correlation between target expression (mRNA and protein) and drug efficacy, and the importance of functional testing for efficacy across a diverse patient population. The unique application of the 3D HCI platform for additional characterization, including ADC binding and uptake assays, will be an essential step to gain insight into the mode of action requirements for ADCs to be effective. These findings highlight the application of functional screening in organoid to better understand the complexity of ADC efficacy and identify responder/non-responder patient profiles to guide on resistance mechanism, in vivo modeling, and biomarker identification for patient stratification.Citation Format:Marten Hornsveld, Jinxi Wang, Jun Zhou, Xiaolong Tu, Peter van Schaik, Mariusz Madej, Hester Bange, Jessie J.J.

    "abstract": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is highly and specifically expressed in prostate cancer while showing limited expression in normal tissues. The FDA\u2019s approval of (177) Lu-PSMA-617 has validated PSMA as a therapeutic target for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we present the development and preclinical characterization of MHB048C, a novel PSMA specific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC).MHB048C comprises a human IgG1 antibody against PSMA, conjugated to the SuperTopoiTM payload, a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor that is 3\u223c5 times more potent than DXd. The drug-antibody ratio is approximately 4.0. Fc function was silenced to minimize nonspecific ADC uptake, and the linker was designed to enhance hydrophilicity and prevent the retro-Michael reaction, improving plasma stability. The antibody preferentially binds to the PSMA dimer rather than the monomer, as only dimers display the native conformation. MHB048C showed strong binding affinity in protein and cell-level assays and was efficiently internalized by LNCaP cells, reaching an internalization rate of \u223c70% within 1 hour. It exhibited potent cytotoxicity in PSMA-positive prostate cancer cell lines with varying PSMA expression levels and demonstrated significant antitumor activity in an LNCaP FGC prostate cancer xenograft model. In GLP monkey studies, MHB048C exhibited a favorable safety profile with no off-target toxicities. The highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was determined to be 45 mg/kg Q3W, the maximum dose tested.In conclusion, MHB048C demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, along with a favorable safety profile, supporting advancement to clinical development.Citation Format:Yile Chen, Ao Li, Bo Liu, Liyuan Zhu, Xiang Meng, Zhili Yao, Yan Wang, Xialian Weng, Xuefeng Zhu, Shiyu Zhou, Junwei Shi, Guoqing Cao.

    "abstract": "Background:AZD9592 is a bispecific ADC designed to target both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition tyrosine kinase receptor (cMET), delivering a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload to tumor cells. Despite recent advances in ADC development for CRC, such as the use of trastuzumab deruxtecan to treat HER2-positive CRC, a significant unmet need remains for novel therapeutic approaches, particularly for patients with limited targeted treatment options.Methods:We evaluated the antitumor efficacy of AZD9592 and explored biomarker-response relationships in CRC PDX models across a range of very low to high EGFR expression (optical density of membrane [OD] 6.7-162.6) and cMET expression (OD 18.5-142.6) measured by immunohistochemistry-quantitative continuous score (IHC-QCS), as well as other molecular features like oncogene drivers. Responses were defined as \u226530% tumor volume reductions from baseline.Results:AZD9592 demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy, with responses observed in 34.5% of models at 8 mg/kg and 14.8% at 4 mg/kg. Biomarker analyses of tumors revealed a significant association between cMET expression levels by IHC-QCS and responses at 8 mg/kg. cMET levels were significantly higher in AZD9592-responsive models than in antibody-responsive and isotype control-responsive models (p<0.02 for both). An optimized cMET expression cutoff had a predictive performance with an area under the curve of 0.73. Compared to wildtype tumors, response rates were not significantly different in tumors harboring mutations in oncogenes that share signaling pathways with EGFR and cMET and where clinical activity of EGFR antibody therapies is limited, including KRAS and BRAF. Moreover, response rates were not significantly different across tumors derived from patients with or without prior irinotecan treatment, a chemotherapy that also inhibits topoisomerase I. Proteomics identified additional molecular features associated with response.Conclusions:AZD9592 demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor activity in CRC PDX models, including KRAS-mutant and KRAS-wildtype tumors. These responses suggest opportunities for clinical development of AZD9592 in CRC and the potential for biomarker-guided patient selection.Citation Format:Ying Zheng, Edward Rosfjord, Simon Christ, Stephanie Zalesak-Kravec, Italia Grenga, Fernanda Arnaldez, Frank Comer, Lara McGrath.

    "abstract": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of rapidly developing targeted biotherapeutic drugs, which consist of three elements: antibody, linker, and payload. ADCs combine the high specificity of antibodies with the potency of payloads, delivering the highly efficient small molecule within the target tumor cells.As one of the new payload types, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist can initiate the innate immune response, enhancing the attack on tumor cells. STING agonist ADCs, allowing tumor-localized activation of STING, may achieve greater anti-tumor activity and better tolerability.By combining the STING binding assay, different THP-1 reporter assay, we can support for STING agonist activities screening. RT-qPCR assay and WB assay can be applied for demonstrating the molecular mechanisms of candidates. For specific screening and evaluation of HER2 STING agonist ADCs, HER2 overexpression reporter assay, co-culture assays of tumor cell lines or STING knockout tumor cell lines with THP-1, hPBMC, as well as whole blood can be utilized at different project stages.Citation Format:Ying Meng, Li Li, Min Kang, Xiao Li, Haiting Dai, Tj (Tiejun) Bing.

    "abstract": "Background:LIV-1, also known as SLC39A6 or ZIP6, a multi- transmembrane protein with putative zinc transporter and metalloproteinase activity. LIV-1 is expressed in a number of cancers with the highest prevalence in breast, prostate, ovary and melanoma, but a limited presence in vital organs. Currently, the clinical-stage ADC drug targeting LIV-1, Ladiratuzumab vedotin (SGN-LIV1A), is undergoing Phase 2 trials and has demonstrated clinical benefits, thus further underscoring LIV-1 as a promising target for advanced solid tumors. Given the broad spectrum of tumor indications addressable by targeting LIV-1, we utilized Simcere Zaiming\u2019 proprietary ADC technology to generate a novel ADC targeted to LIV-1 named SCR-A003.Method:SCR-A003 is comprised of a LIV-1-targeted monoclonal antibody linked to a novel cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor by a protease-cleavable linker. Pharmacokinetic study was conducted in mice in which SCR-A003 administered IV infusion. In vivo efficacy studies were conducted in immunodeficient mice with human tumor cell-lines including NCI-H838 and OVCAR3.The anti-tumor efficacy of SCR-A003 was evaluated in comparison to SGN-LIV1A analogue.Result:SCR-A003 had highly specific binding affinity with human and could cross-bind to cyno LIV-1. Moreover, SCR-A003 exhibited excellent internalization and cell killing ability on multiple tumor cells in-vitro assay. SCR-A003, demonstrated specific, dose-dependent in vivo antitumor activity toward LIV-1-positive tumor xenografts representing lung, ovary and breast cancers. Compared to SGN-LIV1A analogue, SCR-A003 exhibited more robust tumor inhibition capacity at lower doses in OVCAR3 and NCI-H838 xenograft models. Additionally, SCR-A003 also showed prolonged serum half-life and higher drug exposure than SGN-LIV1A analogue in pharmacokinetic study.Conclusions:SCR-A003, exhibited a favorable preclinical profile, with potent in vivo activity toward LIV-1-expressing tumor xenografts representing a range of cancer indications. These data support clinical development of SCR-A003 for the treatment of LIV-1-expressing solid cancers.Citation Format:Yayuan Fu, Changyan Chen, Xiaohua Yan, Zhiyong Yu, Zhuangzhi Zhao, Jingli Liao, Zhenyun Tian, Renhong Tang.

    "abstract": "Background:Cadherin is a superfamily of cell adhesion molecules that depend on Ca2+ and play an important role in maintaining tissue architecture. Abnormal expression of Cadherins is often associated with malformation of tissues, tumor formation, and metastasis. Cadherin-17 (CDH17) also known as hepatocyte-enterocyte cadherin, is a non-classical member of the calcium-dependent cadherin superfamily. Unlike classical cadherins, the CDH17 sequence is formed by seven extracellular calcium-dependent cadherin domains and a very short cytoplasmic domain. CDH17 is a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates cell-cell adhesion in intestinal epithelial cells. Studies have found that CDH17 expression is limited to the intestinal and pancreatic duct epithelial cells in human normal tissues. However, in tumor tissues, CDH17 is highly expressed in various digestive tract tumors, such as gastric cancer (73%), colorectal cancer (100%) and pancreatic cancer (31%). Some studies have also reported positive staining for CDH17 in about 6% of lung cancer patients, 11% of ovarian cancer patients, and 2% of liver cancer patients. These results suggest that CDH17 may be a potential therapeutic target in related tumors, especially digestive tract tumors.Methods& Results: We developed a novel CDH17-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) called SCR-A008, which is comprised of an anti-CDH17 humanized monoclonal antibody conjugated with novel topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (CPT116) via a hydrophilic cleavable linker at DAR 8. SCR-A008 specifically recognizes human and cyno CDH17 with high affinity. In vitro cytotoxicity experiment demonstrated that SCR-A008 induced tumor cell lysis in various tumor cell type. Compared to MMAE-based CDH17-ADC, SCR-A008 exhibits significantly stronger anti-tumor activity in colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, we utilized CDX and PDX model to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of SCR-A008. The results showed that SCR-A008 inhibited tumor growth of various tumors in a dose dependent manner. SCR-A008 also have good stability and favorable developability. Pharmacokinetics and tolerability were assessed in mouse and cynomolgus monkey. The pharmacokinetics experiment in mice showed better PK characteristic than the reference ADC.Conclusion:These findings suggest that SCR-A008 is a potential Best-in-Class therapeutic drug for CDH17-positive solid tumor.Citation Format:Guangcun Cheng, Hui Zheng, Zhiyong Yu, Chunlei Xia, Huipeng Guo, Xiyuan Wang, Yayuan Fu, Renhong Tang.

    "abstract": "Several promising therapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) targeting specific genetic and epigenetic mutations have been reported. However, there remains a critical need for novel therapies with higher efficacy and favorable safety profiles particularly for patients with poor-risk cytogenetic features, such as TP53 mutation, or those with relapsed and refractory AML. G1 to S phase transition 1 (GSPT1) is a small GTPase that interacts with eRF1, the translation termination factor, to facilitate the process of translation termination. GSPT1 has been well known to play a critical role in the proliferation of AML and MYC-driven lung cancer. Recently, molecular glue degraders (MGDs) targeting GSPT1 have emerged as a new class of cancer therapies and have shown early promise in clinical trials for AML. However, clinical development of GSPT1 MGDs, such as CC-885 and CC-90009, has been hampered by off-target toxicities. To improve both target specificity and the therapeutic window, we discovered TRX-214-1002, a CD33-targeting ADC that used the same monoclonal antibody (mAb) as Mylotarg, conjugated with a novel proprietary GSPT1 MGD as the payload. The in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of TRX-214-1002 were compared with ORM-6151 (another GSPT1 MG degrader-based CD33 ADC) and Mylotarg. TRX-214-1002 demonstrated superior and sustained degradability against GSPT1 compared to ORM-6151, and it exhibited potent anti-leukemic activity with picomolar GI50 values in TP53 or FLT3 mutated AML cell lines. Importantly, it highly spared CD33-negative leukemia cell and human PBMC, with an in vitro therapeutic index greater than 100-fold. We also observed that TRX-214-1002 significantly upregulated integrated stress response markers (ATF4, CHOP, ATF3) and impaired neo-protein synthesis, consistent with apoptosis induction. Interestingly, TRX-214-1002 maintained potent anti-leukemic activity even in venetoclax-resistant HL-60 cells and in drug-resistant milieu derived from bone marrow stromal HS-5 cells. Furthermore, a single 1 mg/kg dose of TRX-214-1002 completely regressed tumors in MV4-11 and HL-60 xenograft models without tumor regrowth until day 42, whereas the ORM-6151-treated group led to transient tumor regression. Pharmacodynamic studies in the HL-60 tumor model showed dose-dependent degradation of GSPT1. In addition, we estimated that the minimum therapeutically effective dose was less than single 1 mg/kg in a disseminated tumor model. Collectively, TRX-214-1002 highlighted the noticeable GSPT1 degradability and enhanced antileukemic activity, particularly in TP53 mutated and venetoclax-resistant AML cell lines, along with significant antitumor activity superior to competitor ADCs. Our preclinical data suggest that TRX-214-1002 has the high potential to provide a novel treatment strategy for CD33 positive relapse/refractory AML patients.Citation Format:Hee Kyu Lee, Seongrak Kim, Dohoon Kim, Seulgi Choi, Jookyung Lee, Sungwon Lee, Eunhyun Choi, Sang Won Park, Kwangwoo Chun, Koo Lee.

    "abstract": "Introduction:The three essential components of an ADC include the mAb, the linker, and the cytotoxic payload. The mAb is designated to target specific tumor-associated antigens that are overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. The mAb PB-223 was developed through the affinity maturation of mAb NEO-102, a chimeric human IgG1 mAb that specifically targets truncated Core-2 O-glycans, found in colorectal and pancreatic cancers. The binding affinity of PB-223 for its target was improved, compared to NEO-102, by optimizing its VH and VL sequences through Fast Screening for Expression Biophysical Properties and Affinity. PB-223 demonstrated a binding affinity (KD) at least 4-fold lower than NEO-102, indicating stronger tumor binding. IHC analysis also revealed that PB-223 binds to a wider spectrum of tumor tissues compared to NEO-102, but not to normal tissues. PB-223 can be internalized into human cancer cell lines expressing its target. The objective of this study is to develop an ADC utilizing PB-223 for treatment of various human malignancies.Experimental Design:PB-223 was used for the development of the ADC. Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) was used as payload, with mc-vc-PABc serving as the linker. PB-223 was conjugated to the linker-payload through a cysteine-based conjugation method. Drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) was measured using Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)-MS. Flow cytometry was used for binding assessment of the ADC using the ovarian cancer cell line OV90 as the target. Cytotoxicity of the ADC was evaluated through cell viability assays using CellTiter-Glo cell viability Kit using OV90.as target.Results:Three ADCs were developed: PB-MMAE-2, PB-MMAE-5 and PB-MMAE-6. The DAR for these ADCs were 3.72, 3.92 and 4.15 respectively. We analyzed their target binding capabilities in comparison to PB-223. The results indicated that all three ADCs exhibit similar binding affinity to PB-223. The cytotoxicity of the ADCs was evaluated using the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 with Trastuzumab deruxtecan ADC (DS-8201) as positive control. At a concentration of 10nM, DS-8201 inhibited cell proliferation by 82.39%. All three PB-223 ADC effectively killed OV90 cells. At a concentration of 333nM, the percentage of cell killing for PB-MMAE-2, PB-MMAE-5 and PB-MMAE-6 was 82.91%, 84.04% and 83.16%, respectively. In contrast, both human IgG1 and naked PB-223 mAb showed no killing of OV90 cells.Conclusions:In this study, we developed PB-223 ADCs and evaluated their anti-tumor efficacy using an in vitro model. We assessed three PB-223 ADCs: PB-MMAE-2, PB-MMAE-5 and PB-MMAE-6. Our findings highlight the potential of these ADCs as innovative options for treating human carcinomas expressing core 2 O-glycans. Further In vivo studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are ongoing.Citation Format:Kwong Y. Tsang, Massimo Fantini, Anjum Zaki, Sharon A. Mavroukakis, Philip M. Arlen.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Vobra duo, a duocarmycin-based humanized ADC (drug-to-antibody ratio is \u223c2.7) targeting B7-H3, shows robust in vivo activity against a range of adult cancer models, and a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys. Initial results from the single agent phase 1 clinical trial of vobra duo (NCT03729596) showed manageable side effects and promising objective response rates in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. B7-H3 is highly expressed in pediatric solid tumors, and it is emerging as a key target for pediatric oncology. Here we report the antitumor activity of vobra duo against preclinical xenograft models of pediatric solid tumors.Methods:Ewing sarcoma (ES), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and neuroblastoma (NB) xenograft models were tested with n=1 or n=2 designs. Osteosarcoma (OS) models, due to their slower growth kinetics and lower rates of tumor regression, were tested with n=10 mice per arm. The study was extended to include malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), hepatoblastoma (HB), and Wilms tumor (WT) models using n=5 mice per treatment group. vobra duo and control ADC (SYD988 anti-CD20 ADC with the same linker and payload as vobra duo) were provided by MacroGenics, Inc., and were administered at 6 mg/kg as a single administration IP. Time-to-event was defined as 4-fold increase in tumor xenograft volume from the day of treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare event-free survival (EFS) between treated and control groups. Objective response categories were determined as described previously (Ped Blood Cancer 2007;49:928-940), with objective responses including partial, complete, and maintained complete responses (PR, CR, and MCR).Results:Vobra duo induced objective responses in 4 of 11 NB models (3 CR and 1 MCR) and in 3 of 5 OS models (2 MCR). ES models showed objective responses in 2 of 6 models (1 MCR) and 4 of 6 RMS models showed objective responses, all MCR. Control ADC was less active than vobra duo and showed objective responses in 0 of 11 NB, 1 of 5 OS, 1 of 6 ES, and 2 of 4 RMS models. The study was extended to MRT, HB, and WT models. Vobra duo induced objective responses in 2 of 4 MRT with 1 MCR, 2 of 5 HB with 2 MCR, and 3 of 4 WT with 3 MCR. Control ADC only induced objective responses in 1 of 4 MRT and 2 of 4 WT models (all PR), with no objective responses for the 5 HB models.Conclusions:Vobra duo is potently efficacious across a broad panel of pediatric solid tumor xenograft models supporting clinical development of this agent and other agents targeting B7-H3 for children with cancer.Citation Format:Haiying Tang, Edward Favours, Samson Ghilu, Peyton Wong, Vanessa Del Pozo, Abhik Bandyopadhyay, Elena Mironova, Eric J.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a breakthrough therapeutic class that provides tumor-targeted cytotoxicity while stimulating immune responses, offering promising potential when combined with immunotherapies and particularly with PD-1 inhibitors. Traditional xenograft tumor models developed in immunodeficient mice are employed to evaluate ADCs' anti-tumor efficacy. However, these models lack competent immune systems and human antigen expression in normal tissues, limiting their capacity to assess immune responses and toxicity. To address these limitations, we developed HuCell, mouse tumor cells engineered to express tumor associated antigen (hTAA) such as HER2, and HuGEMM, humanized for a specific drug target within mice with a functional immune system. In this study HuCell/HuGEMM humanized mouse models were developed to evaluate the efficacy of ADCs in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and toxicity.Methods:Surface expression of human HER2, Trop2, and Nectin-4 on MC-38 HuCell was verified using flow cytometry before and after inoculation on mice. 5\u00d7106 HuCells were subcutaneously inoculated into hHER2, hTrop2, hNectin4 and hHER2/hPD-1 models in C57BL/6 background or wild-type (WT) models. Tumor-bearing models were treated with monotherapy of trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-Dxd), sacituzumab govitecan or enfortumab vedotin, or combination therapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies. For the toxicity study, 180 mg/kg T-Dxd and 100 mg/kg trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) were injected into hHER2 mice weekly for two doses by intravenous injection.Results:A highly HER2-expressing HuCell line (clone #2) successfully grew in hHER2 models but not in WT models, with tumors displaying nearly 100% of human Her2 positive cells with high surface expression (2\u00d7105 molecules per cell). In dose response study, T-Dxd significantly inhibited tumor growth at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg in C57BL/6-hHER2. Combination treatment of T-Dxd (4 mg/kg+2 mg/kg, QW) with Keytruda (5 mg/kg, BIW\u00d72) resulted in a complete response rate (8/8) with 87% TGI (p<0.01) compared to T-Dxd monotherapy (7/8) with 96% TGI (p<0.001) in hHER2/PD-1 double knock in mice. In a toxicity study, T-DM1 showed liver toxicity, whereas T-Dxd did not. Both T-DM1 and T-Dxd exhibited notable hematological toxicity, consistent with clinical observations. In the Trop2 and Nectin-4 HuCell/HuGEMM studies, similar results were observed. HuGEMM models demonstrated superior positive cell rate and single-cell antigen expression levels. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was observed when PD-1 therapy was combined with monotherapy.Conclusion:HuCell and HuGEMM models provide an advanced platform to evaluate ADC drug monotherapy and combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, they offer a sophisticated solution to assess both on-target and off-target toxicity of ADCs.Citation Format:Xiaoze Wang, Rong Wang, Kaixia Lian, Rongfei Lu, Jian Feng, Jun Zhou, Xiaolong Tu, Xinhe Feng, Jie Lin, Fuping Xu, Ludovic Bourre, Jingjing Wang.

    "abstract": "Background:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP-2) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (cMET) are promising therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their clinical application requires robust and rapid biomarker evaluation that addresses expression heterogeneity and avoid interobserver variability. Current approaches based on pathologist assessments are limited by subjectivity and scalability. This study aimed to develop a generalizable AI model for ADC biomarker evaluation, trained on TROP-2 and inferred on cMET, to validate its adaptability across markers. Additionally, the model\u2019s performance was compared with expert pathologists to assess its clinical utility. Finally, biomarker prevalence in the two main NSCLC subtypes, namely adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), was evaluated.Methods:We collected a bicentric real-world sample group of 1142 patients with resected NSCLC from the Charit\u00e9, Berlin and the University Hospital Cologne. For tissue microarray construction, two 1.5-mm tissue cores were punched from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks. Immunohistochemical staining for TROP-2 and cMET was performed and sections were scanned for AI-based analysis. The AI pipeline comprised three models: a cell detection model for the identification of cells, a cell classification model for the differentiation of tumor and other cells, and an expression scoring model for membranous biomarker quantification. The model was trained on TROP-2, and subsequently inferred on cMET, thus enabling an evaluation of cross-marker generalization. Five pathologists with varying levels of expertise manually evaluated a representative subset, using H-scoring. Finally, the results were compared with those yielded by the AI model.Results:The expression scoring model achieved a macro-averaged F1 score of 94% for TROP-2 and 91% for cMET. Moreover, the model demonstrated excellent concordance with expert pathologists (TROP-2: 93%; cMET: 95% average pair-wise Pearson correlation). TROP-2 overexpression was significantly higher in LUSC (mean H-score: 154.67) than LUAD (mean H-score: 86.57), while cMET showed the opposite trend (mean H-score LUAD: 59.52; LUSC: 25.68).Conclusion:This study highlights the potential of AI models to address key challenges in ADC biomarker evaluation, including expression heterogeneity, interobserver variability, and reduction in time expenditure. By successfully generalizing between TROP-2 and cMET, the model demonstrates adaptability and scalability for broader clinical applications. These findings pave the way for integrating AI into clinical workflows, improving patient stratification, and optimizing ADC therapy selection. Future efforts will focus on expanding this approach to additional biomarkers and validating its utility in prospective clinical trials.Citation Format:Philipp Anders, Philipp Erwin Seegerer, Katja Lingelbach, Suhas Pandhe, Sandip Ghosh, Cornelius B\u00f6hm, Stephan Tietz, Rosemarie Krupar, Lars Tharun, Marie-Lisa Eich, Julika Ribbat-Idel, Verena Aumiller, Sabine Merkelbach-Bruse, Alexander Quaas, Nikolaj Frost, Georg Schlachtenberger, Matthias Heldwein, Ulrich Keilholz, Khosro Hekmat, Jens-Carsten R\u00fcckert, Reinhard B\u00fcttner, David Horst, Maximilian Alber, Lukas Ruff, Frederick Klauschen, Gabriel Dernbach, Simon Schallenberg.

    "abstract": "PD-L1 is widely expressed across various cancer types and suppresses immune responses against tumor cells. EGFR is also highly expressed in many solid tumors and plays a key role in driving tumor growth. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway and the EGF/EGFR signaling pathway using antagonistic antibodies or ADCs has shown promising results in cancer therapy. However, both approaches can lead to undesirable \"on-target/off-tumor\" effects. Co-expression of PD-L1 and EGFR is rare in normal tissues but is commonly observed in most PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. In this study, we developed a bispecific antibody, KA-2887, using our common light chain antibody discovery platform to target both EGFR and PD-L1. This bispecific antibody was then used to construct the ADC KA-2887-LD38. KA-2887-LD38 has a conventional IgG1 structure, conjugated with LD-38, an Escugen proprietary ADC platform composed of TopIi payload and highly hydrophilic stable cleavable linker. It binds to EGFR with an affinity of 3.7 nM and to PD-L1 with an affinity of 0.6 nM. KA-2887-LD38 effectively blocks both the interaction between EGF and EGFR, and the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1.The expression of EGFR on tumor cells enhances the inhibitory effect of KA-2887-LD38 on the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, and vice versa. Compared to monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-L1, KA-2887-LD38 shows a much faster internalization rate when binding to tumor cells co-expressing EGFR and PD-L1. In vitro, KA-2887-LD38 demonstrates cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing either EGFR and PD-L1 together or EGFR alone, but has a weaker effect on tumor cells expressing only PD-L1. Tumor cells co-expressing EGFR and PD-L1 are more sensitive to KA-2887-LD38. Additionally, KA-2887-LD38 exhibits strong bystander killing activity. Xenograft mouse tumor models show that KA-2887-LD38 strongly inhibits the growth of various tumor types, including NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Toxicity studies on KA-2887-LD38 are ongoing. The results suggest that KA-2887-LD38 holds significant potential for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors.Citation Format:Guojin Wu, Chuanying Xu, Weihong Nian, Zhengcheng Guo, Jiabei Liang, Feng He, Qing Zhou, Jinying Ning.

    "abstract": "B7-H3, a member of the B7 family of proteins, is overexpressed in various solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while exhibiting minimal expression in healthy tissues. This unique expression profile positions B7-H3 as a promising target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Multiple B7H3-targeting ADCs are currently being tested in different stages of clinical trials and several of them have reported antitumor activities in heavily treated patients. In this study, we introduce BB-1712, a novel B7-H3-targeting ADC that incorporates eribulin as its cytotoxic payload, with the potential to treat patients not sensitive to ADCs containing DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors as payload toxin such as DS-7300a. BB-1712 was designed to leverage eribulin's distinct mechanism of action, which effectively inhibits tumor growth through multiple mode of actions including promotion of apoptosis, tumor microenvironment modulation, immunogenic cell death and bystander killing. We conducted extensive preclinical evaluations of BB-1712, focusing on its in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo tumor inhibitory activities against a range of B7-H3-expressing cancer cell lines and xenograft models.Our results demonstrated that BB-1712 exhibited binding activity to B7-H3-positive cell lines similarly to that of Infinatamab, and displayed potent cytotoxic effects across multiple human cancer models, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer and small cell lung cancer cell lines. In xenograft studies, BB-1712 achieved significant tumor regression at well-tolerated doses without obvious toxicity. Notably, BB-1712 effectively overcame resistance to DS-7300a in both SCLC and NSCLC models previously treated with this agent. Pharmacokinetic and toxicology assessments in non-human primates revealed a favorable safety profile for BB-1712 at clinically relevant dosages and administration schedules.In summary, our findings suggest that BB-1712 has promising preclinical efficacy and safety profiles as well as the potential to circumvent resistance mechanisms associated with current therapies. These results support the advancement of BB-1712 into clinical trials for patients with B7-H3-expressing solid tumors.Citation Format:Yang Wang, Bing Xia, Lixia Cao, Jianfeng Yang, Cui Feng, Fangdun Jiang, Chen Li, Lixia Gu, Yifan Yang, Jing Tian, Jiasheng Geng, Qi Zhang, Ziping Wei, Yuhong Zhou.

    "abstract": "Claudin 6 (CLDN6), a member of the claudin family of tight junction proteins, is highly expressed in multiple solid tumors such as ovarian and endometrial cancers with limited expression in normal tissues. Here we developed an anti-CLDN6 ADC C6P comprising a Fc-silenced anti-CLDN6 monoclonal antibody, a cleavable linker and a modified PBD (compound A). C6P selectively bound to CLDN6 without cross-reactivity to other claudin family members such as CLDN 3/4/5/8/9. Additionally, it also bound to I143V-mutated CLDN6, a major single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in human population. The antibody demonstrated strong binding affinity to several ovarian cancer cell lines with different CLDN6 expression levels and showed good endocytosis. Compound A was an optimized mono-imine PBD dimer with less cytotoxicity than conventional bis-imine PBD dimers. High systemic clearance of this payload was also designed to minimize toxicities. To achieve homogeneous ADC, a glycan mediated site-specific conjugation was used to generate C6P. C6P showed CLDN6-dependent growth inhibition against various cell lines, without effect on CLDN6 negative cells. In PA-1 and OVCAR3 xenograft mouse models, C6P showed a dose-dependent anti-tumor effect and led to robust and sustained tumor regression. C6P demonstrated good stability and safety profiles, likely due to site-specific conjugation and the higher systemic clearance of compound A. Less than 1% payload release was observed in human plasma after a 21-days incubation. C6P was well-tolerated at a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys and did not show hematology-related toxicity. The intact ADC/total antibody AUC ratio was above 95%, and the payload was undetectable in the plasma of cynomolgus monkeys after injection with C6P. Overall, the highly specific CLDN6-targeting antibody, the optimized PBD payload, site-specific conjugation and well-controlled DAR value collectively contributed to the potent anti-tumor efficacy, and good safety profile of C6P, supporting its future clinical research.Citation Format:Xiaolan Yu, Shuting Wang, Lingfeng You, Zhibin Xu, Zhendong Xue, Yuchang Mao, Shuyu Cai, Jun Feng, Ting Zhang, Xin Ye, Min Hu, Feng He.

    "abstract": "Our recent studies identified the cell surface protein IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) as a crucial regulator of redox homeostasis and a suppressor of ferroptosis (iron-mediated cell death) in Ewing sarcoma (EwS). IL1RAP directly binds to the CD98/xCT plasma membrane antiporter to enhance cystine uptake, thereby replenishing cysteine and glutathione (GSH) pools in EwS cells. Moreover, when extracellular cystine is limited, IL1RAP induces cystathionine gamma lyase (CTH) to activate the transsulfuration (TSS) pathway for de novo cysteine synthesis. IL1RAP depletion diminishes GSH pools and induces oxidative stress to trigger anoikis and ferroptosis, thereby inhibiting EwS metastatic capacity. Importantly, IL1RAP is minimally expressed in normal tissues, including blood and bone marrow, with placenta as the only normal tissue to express IL1RAP, nominating this protein as a promising immunotherapy target. Here, we uncover that distinct fusion oncoproteins activate IL1RAP expression in cancers of different lineages, including EWS-ETS fusions in Ewing sarcoma (EwS), the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in diverse tumor types, and the NPM-ALK fusion in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). To target IL1RAP in these cancers via immunotherapy, we identified a highly specific IL1RAP binder from phage-display biopanning, and engineered an IL1RAP-directed human IgG based antibody-drug conjugate (ADC; X12-IL1RAP-PBD) linked to the DNA damaging agent, pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD). In proof-of-concept studies, our proprietary X12-IL1RAP-PBD induced potent DNA damage, apoptosis, and bystander cell killing in in vitro. In preclinical mouse models, X12-IL1RAP-PBD induces dramatic and durable regression of tumor xenografts expressing of the oncofusions at dosing of only 0.2mg/kg. Moreover, essentially no signs of toxicity were noted, with stable body weights and no histological evidence of toxicity in vital organs such as liver, lung, kidney, and brain. Moreover, X12-IL1RAP-PBD fully blocked tail vein injected EwS cell-induced liver changes in vivo, again without any toxicity. Thus, this first-in-class IL1RAP-targeting ADC is highly efficacious in preclinical models of multiple oncofusion-driven cancers, warranting further clinical translation.Citation Format:Haifeng Zhang, Wei Li, Xiaqiu Yang, Qingfeng Huang, Yue Zhou Huang, Alberto Delaidelli, Andrew Lytle, Melanie Rouleau, Christian Steidl, Dimiter Dimitrov, Poul Sorensen.

    "abstract": "Background:The integrins are a family of cell surface receptors existing as heterodimers formed with one \u03b1 subunit and one \u03b2 subunit, and there are 24 heterodimers identified so far. These receptors play diverse roles in cellular adhesion, motility, and cytokinesis. Integrin \u03b24 (ITGB4), also known as CD104, binds to integrin \u03b16 (ITGA6) to form \u03b16\u03b24 integrin heterodimer that is recognized as a ligand of laminin and plays a critical role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin. The cytoplasmic tail of ITGB4 contains approximately 1000 amino acids which is longer than any other integrin \u03b2 subunit. ITGB4 interacts with and plays important roles in multiple tumor-promoting signaling pathways including ErbB2, PI3K, FAK/AKT, and c-MET, and has been frequently reported as a potential prognostic and predictive marker in various cancers.Methods& Results: Utilizing our proprietary AI-based target identification platform, ITGB4 was identified as a promising therapeutic target for multiple malignancies. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining confirmed high ITGB4 expression in tumor tissues from patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). CS5006, an ITGB4-targeted ADC, comprises a humanized anti-ITGB4 antibody, a proprietary CSL linker, and the well-validated topoisomerase 1 inhibitor exatecan (EXd). The plasma-stable, hydrophilic, beta-glucuronide CSL linker enables effectively tumor-selective toxin release. Both CS5006 and the humanized ITGB4-targeted antibody H86.2 exhibited selective binding to ITGB4 with high affinity, and triggered rapid, high-level internalization. In vitro cytotoxicity assays demonstrated CS5006\u2019s potent, target-dependent killing of ITGB4-expressing tumor cell lines. CS5006 also showed robust in vivo antitumor activity in CDX models originated from multiple cancer types, with minimal effective dose (MED) of 5 mg/kg. Pilot toxicity studies in non-human primate demonstrated a favorable safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of CS5006.Conclusion:CS5006 is a novel ITGB4-targeted ADC with robust preclinical efficacy and a favorable safety and PK profile. These findings support further IND-enabling and clinical evaluation of CS5006 as a promising ADC therapy for various advanced solid tumors.Citation Format:Chuan Wang, Yamin Wang, Xinling Zhang, Ning Zhang, Yilin Huo, Yongwang Li, Xuelian Liu, Mengyao Zhu, Jingyu Sun, Yongli Yang, Yuxin Qian, Xueqin Dai, Fei Ma, Yi Sun, Jianxin Yang.

    "abstract": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein folate receptor, is highly expressed in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and expression increases following androgen deprivation therapy. TD001 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a deimmunized anti-PSMA IgG1 monoclonal antibody (HuJ591), conjugated to a highly stable, protease-cleavable proprietary Topo I inhibitor exatecan linker-payload (LD038), with a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. Free payload and total ADC were evaluated in mouse plasma, tumor, and liver, after TD001 10 mg/kg IV (which has potent antitumor activity in vivo) in 2 human CRPC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models, LNCaP-abl (high PSMA expression \u223c104 ligands/cell) and 22Rv1 (intermediate/heterogeneous PSMA \u223c102-104 ligands/cell) in castrated NRG/NSG mice. The TD001 PK profile was characterized across a wide temporal span post treatment, in LNCaP-abl (5 min to 10 days) and 22Rv1 (2 h to 6 days). The PK/PD profile of a range of doses (3-20 mg/kg) was characterized in both models. Dose proportional free exatecan concentrations were observed in tumor and plasma, and a consistently high tumor/plasma (T/P) ratio (\u223c70-100 fold) was seen in both tumor models across the range of TD001 doses tested. Potent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was dose dependent up to 20 mg/kg. PK/PD and the high therapeutic index with different dosing schedules are presented separately. Free exatecan was detected in tumors 5 min post treatment in LNCaP-abl. Free exatecan concentrations were approximately 80x higher in tumor compared to plasma 2 h post treatment, and at least 100x higher from 6 h to 6 days post treatment, showing rapid and high distribution of TD001 to the targeted tumor tissue regardless of PSMA expression levels. The concentration of total ADC (assuming constant DAR 8) was \u223c200 \u00b5g/mL (5 min post treatment), remained high for up to 6 days post treatment, while decreasing gradually from 24 h allowing for prolonged tumor exposure to TD001. The high and prolonged T/P ratio supports the excellent therapeutic index observed in TGI studies in both CDX castrated mice models, with TGI >90% and good tolerance (described separately). Of note, exatecan plasma levels rapidly declined under 0.5 ng/mL (from 24 h) and were under the limit of quantification (0.1 ng/mL) 10 days post treatment, preventing systemic toxicity. No free exatecan accumulation was observed after repeat dosing (described separately). TD001 effectively and preferentially delivers the potent exatecan payload to tumor tissue, with minimal systemic exposure, contributing to an excellent therapeutic index and strong antitumor activity in multiple CRPC models with high or intermediate PSMA expression. Our preclinical PK data support clinical development of TD001 in PSMA-expressing CRPC patients.Citation Format:Lavinia Morosi, Daniela Impellizzieri, Roberta Frapolli, Elisa Storelli, Atik Balla, Carlo V.

    "abstract": "CD37 is a trans-membrane protein exclusively expressed in hematopoietic tissues. Increased CD37 expression has been measured on malignant B-cells and its relevance as an attractive therapeutic target has been confirmed in several clinical trials. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), increased CD37 expression on blasts and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) has also been reported, both at protein and mRNA levels. This increased expression is restricted to malignant cells compared to hematopoietic stem cells and correlates with poor patient outcome.We confirmed broad expression of CD37 across patients in 53 AML and 15 MDS primary samples and observed a strong internalization capability particularly suitable for an ADC therapy. Debio 1562M, a 2nd generation CD37-targeting ADC, is active at sub-nanomolar level across all AML models evaluated, irrespective of their treatment history, physiological subtype, genetic alterations, or mutation background. Sensitivity to Debio 1562M was not correlated with CD37 expression level suggesting a development in all comer\u2019s population.We assessed the effect of Debio 1562M on LSCs derived from 14 primary AML samples, where a 10nM treatment was able to decrease the number of colony formation by 80% compared to control. Additionally, we confirmed the capacity of Debio 1562M to reach tumor cells present in the bone marrow (BM) of NSG mice inoculated with MOLM-13 AML cells, suggesting that tumor cells in the BM can be targeted by Debio 1562M to allow LSCs elimination. Debio 1562M activity was benchmarked against several targeted therapies such as menin, FLT3, IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors or gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) CD33-targeting ADC, in different in vivo models. In MOLM-13 xenografted mice, Debio 1562M induced tumor regression after a single injection similarly to GO, while the menin inhibitor revumenib achieved tumor stasis with twice daily administrations and the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib only achieved partial response after daily administrations. Similarly, in 4 patient-derived xenograft models bearing FLT3, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, Debio 1562M led to greater circulating blast reduction compared to gilteritinib, ivosidenib IDH1 inhibitor and enasidenib IDH2 inhibitor. In summary, Debio 1562M monotherapy shows superior activity than targeted therapies in preclinical AML models.The toxicological profile of Debio 1562M in mice showed expected off-target toxicity related to the payload\u2019s activity. On-target toxicity profile of Debio 1562M could not be evaluated due to lack of cross-reactive species, however no significant toxicity on human PBMCs was observed in vitro. In conclusion, the promising antitumor activity and tolerability of Debio 1562M in preclinical models pave the way for entering clinical development in AML in 2025.Citation Format:Lisa Ivanschitz, Jos\u00e9e Hue-Perron, Alain Monjardet, Noemie Luong, Esthela Artiga, Karilyn T.

    "abstract": "Human trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are often overexpressed in a variety of human cancers. Both anti-PD-L1 antibodies and TROP2-based antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have shown significant clinical benefit, and a number of these agents, including atezolizumab and durvalumab (both anti-PD-L1 antibodies) and sacituzumab govitecan (an anti-TROP2-SN38 ADC), have been approved by the US FDA for certain cancer indications. The efficacy of these agents is, however, often limited by the unwanted on-target/off-tumor toxicities and the emergence of resistance of tumor cells. In this study, we engineered a humanized bispecific antibody (bsAb) simultaneously targeting both TROP2 and PD-L1 and produced several drug conjugates utilizing various linkers and cytotoxic payloads. The bsAb ADC binds efficiently to tumor cells that express either or co-express both TROP2 and PD-L1, trigger rapid ADC internalization, and induce potent tumor killing activity. Further, the bsAb ADC also effectively blocks PD1/PD-L1 interaction, and in parallel, induce PD-L1 internalization and down-regulation on tumor cell surface, resulting in significantly enhanced T cell activation for tumor cell killing. In multiple xenografted tumor models, the bsAb ADC demonstrated greater tumor inhibitory activity than their respective monospecific parent antibody ADCs. Taken together, our findings support further development of this bsAb ADC for the treatment of multiple TROP2- and/or PD-L1-expressing cancers, and of those patients who are refractory and/or resistant to TROP2 or PD-L1 single target-based therapies.Citation Format:Chuan Chen, Liang Tian, Chenpeng Su, Dandan Liu, Jiyuan Tian, Yujuan Li, Bing Yang, Yongxin Shan, Xiaoqian Chen, Jian Peng, Zhenping Zhu.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Mucin-17 (MUC17) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, expressed on the apical membrane of normal gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial cells, play important roles in preventing infection at mucosal surfaces1-2. MUC17 is a promising target for ADC development due to its highly expressed in gastric, colon and pancreatic cancers, but limit normal organs expression.Methods:HDM2012 is a MUC17 targeting ADC, consisting of a topoisomerase inhibitor via a cleavable liker with average drug antibody ratio (DAR) 8. The efficacy and safety of HDM2012 was tested in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models and monkeys, respectively.Results:HDM2012 showed target dependent anti-tumor activity and by-stander effect in vitro. HDM2012 exhibits good efficacy in PDX and CDX models. In gastric PDX models, HDM2012 demonstrated dose dependent efficacy, with TGI (tumor growth inhibition) value of 82-93%, regardless of prior Ironitecan and Top-I ADC treatment. In heavily pre-treated colon cancer PDX models, HDM2012 induced prolonged tumor regression, with TGI value of 94.6%. Furthermore, in MUC17 low expression pancreatic PDX models, HDM2012 could induce sustained tumor regression, with TGI value of 91.5%. In exploratory toxicology study, HDM2012 is well tolerated by cynomolgus monkeys at 45 mpk.Conclusion:Here, we reporting a novel ADC product HDM2012 targeting MUC17, is a potential therapeutic approach for MUC17 positive GC, CRC, PDAC cancer treatment. All the experiment data indicated HDM2012 may be a promising candidate for GI cancer treatment.Reference:1. Gum JR, et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun.2002;291:466-475. 2. Van Putten JPM, et al.

    "abstract": "Background:FGFR2b (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 IIIb), an isoform of transmembrane tyrosine kinase FGFR family, is overexpressed in various cancers, including gastric, esophageal, breast, hepatocellular, pancreatic, ovary, uterine, cervical, endometrial, lung, colorectal cancers. Bemarituzumab (FPA144) is an afucosylated humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting FGFR2b with enhanced ADCC activity, which had promising clinical efficacy in phase 2 study of FGFR2b-selected gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Simcere Zaiming has developed a potential first-in-class FGFR2b-targeting ADC (SCR-A002) at IND-enabling status, displaying significantly superior anti-tumor potency compared to Bemarituzumab.Methods:Using hybridoma technique, anti-FGFR2b antibody was generated from immunization of FGFR2b protein in mice. SCR-A002 was comprised of a humanized anti-FGFR2b IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated through a cleavable linker to proprietary TOPO1 inhibitor payload (DAR 8). Binding activity and cytotoxicity were assessed in FGFR2b+ tumor cell line. And anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated in several CDX and PDX models.Results:SCR-A002 specifically bound to FGFR2b on tumor cells and could be internalized, and the TOPO1 inhibitor could be cleaved intracellularly and then exhibited potent cytotoxicity to tumor cells. And tumor regression was achieved after single-dose administration of SCR-A002 in different FGFR2b expression level CDX and PDX models, even with big-size tumor or Bemarituzumab resistance.Conclusion:SCR-A002 showed remarkable anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical data, suggesting that SCR-A002 is expected to provide a new treatment option as single agent or combo with SoC for patients with FGFR2b-overexpressing solid tumor.Citation Format:Yayuan Fu, Yuanjie Ge, Xiaohui Shao, Qi Deng, Chunlei Xia, Renhong Tang.

    "abstract": "Background:The HGF/cMET signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and other normal physiological functions. cMET is expressed in many different normal tissues but is usually expressed at low levels. Abnormal expression and dysfunction of cMET have been found in a variety of tumors. cMET is a well-established target in clinical, but its clinical application is limited, because clinical efficacy was mainly observed in cMET signaling driving tumor or cMET-high expression tumors. To extend the potential therapeutic population and anti-tumor activity, we searching for some new approaches, such as bispecific antibody drug conjugates. Bioinformatics analysis and translational research showed that cMET and B7H3 are co-expressed in multiple types of solid tumors without high expression in normal tissues. Therefore, targeting both B7H3 and cMET could be a new and powerful strategy in pan-tumor therapy.Methods& Results: We developed a novel B7H3xcMET targeted bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) called SCR-A0011, which is comprised of B7H3/cMET bispecific antibody conjugated with novel topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (CPT116). SCR-A0011 specifically bind B7H3 and cMET with high affinity, and showed enhanced internalization and binding capacity compared to parental monoclonal antibody ADC separately in the B7H3/cMET co-expressing cell line. SCR-A0011 induced tumor cell lysis in various tumor cell types including NSCLC, CRC, OC, HNSCC, etc. SCR-A0011 showed remarkable anti-tumor efficacy in several CDX models in a dose dependent manner. SCR-A0011 exhibits significantly stronger anti-tumor activity than their parental monoclonal-ADC or clinical ADC in B7H3+cMET+ double positive tumor cells. SCR-A0011 also have very good stability and favorable developability.Conclusion:These findings illustrated SCR-A011 could be a potential First-in-Class BsADC to conquer the resistance or non-response of current treatment in broad cancer types and may provide a new therapeutic approach for B7H3 and cMET positive cancer patients in the future.Citation Format:Yayuan Fu, Guangcun Cheng, Hui Zheng, Shuai Wang, Lei Jiang, Chunlei Xia, Huipeng Guo, Xiyuan Wang, Renhong Tang.

    "abstract": "CD73, also known as ecto-5'-nucleotidase, is a cell surface enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of AMP to adenosine. It is highly expressed in various types of cancers, including gastric, glioblastoma, non-small cell lung, and colorectal cancers. Elevated CD73 expression is highly correlated with poor prognosis, increased metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy. In the tumor microenvironment, CD73-derived adenosine exerts multiple immunosuppressive effects, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Currently, there are no approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting CD73. In this study, we introduce BB-1709, a CD73-targeting ADC that incorporates MMAE as its cytotoxic payload, demonstrating its antitumor activity through direct cytotoxicity against CD73-expressing tumor cells and its ability to inhibit CD73 enzyme activity.A comprehensive set of studies was conducted to assess its in vitro cytotoxicity, in vivo antitumor activity as well as its ability to inhibit CD73 enzyme activity.In vitro studies demonstrated that BB-1709 exhibited potent and selective cytotoxicity against various CD73-positive cancer cells and significantly inhibited CD73 enzyme activity, effectively blocking the conversion of AMP into adenosine. In vivo studies using xenograft models showed that a single dose of BB-1709 resulted in substantial antitumor activity. Pharmacokinetic and toxicology assessments in non-human primates revealed a favorable safety profile for BB-1709 at clinically relevant dosages and administration schedules.In summary, these results suggest that BB-1709 not only exhibits good preclinical efficacy and safety, but also has the potential to promote anti-tumor immune responses by inhibiting CD73 enzymatic activity. A phase I clinical trial of BB-1709 is currently underway to further explore its therapeutic potential in cancer treatment.Citation Format:Bing Xia, Lixia Cao, Jianfeng Yang, Cui Feng, Fangdun Jiang, Chen Li, Lixia Gu, Yifan Yang, Jing Tian, Jiasheng Geng, Ziping Wei, Yuhong Zhou.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Tumor organoids replicate cancer lesions and capture tumor heterogeneity in vitro, and are invaluable for cancer drug development. Combining Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) models with corresponding Patient-Derived Xenograft Organoid (PDXO) models offers a comprehensive approach, enabling high-throughput, scalable in vitro data collection and providing insights into tumor behavior and drug responses in vivo. HER2 amplification is frequent in cancers like breast and gastric cancer, and HER2-targeted ADCs have shown exceptional efficacy. To support preclinical and mechanistic investigations that develop next-generation HER2-targeted ADCs and therapies, we established a preclinical panel of paired PDX-PDXO models with varying HER2 expression levels.Methods:Gastric (GA) and breast cancer (BR) PDXOs were generated from PDX tissue and authenticated by SNP assay. Morphology, histopathology, and genomic profiling were performed and compared with its corresponding PDX. ERBB2 expression and HER2 levels in PDX-PDXOs were detected by RNA sequencing and IHC. In vivo efficacy of 10 mpk DS8201 was studied in the PDXs, and in vitro IC50 was assessed in the PDXOs using CellTiterGlo (CTG) and High Content Imaging (HCI), allowing differentiation between cytostatic and cytotoxic responses. Correlation analysis of DS8201 response were performed based on the efficacy data from PDXOs and PDXs.Results:34 GA and 24 BR PDXOs were developed from PDX tumors originally established from patients' biopsies. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining showed distinct features within PDXOs, similar to the corresponding PDXs. High correlation (>95%) in mutation and gene expression demonstrated that PDXOs largely preserve the genomic and transcriptomic features of the originating tumors. In vivo and in vitro efficacy studies of DS8201 were performed in 14 pairs of GA and BR PDX-PDXOs, among which 12 pairs display consistent HER2 IHC scores between PDX and PDXO. Overall, 6 out of 7 DS8201-sensitive PDXOs were also sensitive in PDXs and showed tumor regression, indicating high positive predictive value (PPV: 0.857) of PDXOs. The average TGI of PDXs classified for the corresponding PDXO as sensitive is much higher than TGI of PDXs classified for the corresponding PDXO as non-sensitive (97% vs. 69%, p=0.13). Besides, DS82001 sensitivity was observed in both HER+ and HER2- models, which might relate to the bystander effect of the payload and heterogeneity of PDX.Conclusion:The paired PDX-PDXO models were successfully established and provided a novel preclinical platform for investigating mechanisms of action (MOA) and resistance in patient-relevant models matched in both in vitro and in vivo stages for developing next-generation HER2-targeting therapies.Citation Format:Jinxi Wang, Jun Zhou, Limei Shang, Qingzhi Liu, Binchen Mao, Yi Sun, Peng Han, Lin Zhang, Likun Zhang, Xiaolong Tu, Wubin Qian, Peng Wang, Leilei Chen, Marten Hornsveld, Marrit Putker, Ludovic Bourre, Jingjing Wang.

    "abstract": "EGFR is a clinically-validated target that is overexpressed and activated in many human cancers and associated with poor prognosis. However, ADCs targeting EGFR exhibit toxicity due to expression on healthy tissue (1), and EGFR can show heterogeneous tumor expression (2). We utilized InduPro\u2019s proprietary MIntTM platform to identify proteins inherently proximal to EGFR on tumor cells. CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) was identified as a TAPA (tumor associated proximity antigen) of interest. Like EGFR, CDCP1 is over-expressed in multiple cancers and plays key roles in oncogenic signaling and malignant transformation (3).IDP-001 is a novel MMAE-conjugated EGFR-CDCP1 bispecific antibody with low DAR. Here we report the preclinical in vivo assessment of IDP-001 in established tumor cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models representing a range of target expression (measured by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry) across multiple solid tumor indications. We also generated isogenic pairs of tumor cell lines with CDCP1 knocked out. IDP-001, along with versions of varying EGFR affinity, or monospecific derivatives thereof, were administered I.V. at a single dose in tumor-bearing mice.Unlike other EGFR ADCs, IDP-001 does not engage immune effector cells and has a serum half-life of \u223c16 hours in mice. It is well tolerated at all doses evaluated, with no signs of body weight loss. Robust, dose-dependent anti-tumor activity was observed in tumor models with dual-target expression, regardless of expression level. Activity is reduced but not absent in CDCP1 knockout tumors and mice treated with EGFR or CDCP1 monospecific ADC controls, demonstrating more selective anti-tumor activity through co-binding. The activity of IDP-001 was also evaluated in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of squamous lung carcinoma, where a high degree of target co-expression is observed in clinical samples. IDP-001 is a first-in-class bispecific ADC with the potential for broad therapeutic activity and best-in-class efficacy. These encouraging in vivo results support advancement of IDP-001 to non-human primate studies.References1. Dan-yun Ruan et al., JCO 42 (2024) 6013-6013.2.

    "abstract": "ADCs targeting the tumor stroma offer a promising strategy to address tumor heterogeneity. Traditional tumor-targeting ADCs face limitations, as intratumor and interpatient variability in target protein expression can result in incomplete targeting. In contrast, the tumor stroma is more genetically stable and consistent across patients. CAFs, the predominant stromal cell type within the tumor microenvironment, play a critical role in cancer progression and immune evasion in multiple cancers. OMTX705, a clinical-stage ADC, targets FAP-positive CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. OMTX705 presents an optimized and highly stable linker and it is quickly internalized and transported to late endosomal compartments in FAP-expressing cells. Its novel cytolysin-based payload demonstrates strong cell killing activity upon specific ADC internalization in FAP positive cells. Indeed, enhanced cytotoxicity was observed when compared to MMAE, particularly in cells with high PgP expression, offering a potential solution for tumor drug resistance. OMTX705 has demonstrated preclinical robust efficacy, achieving 100% tumor growth inhibition and even regression, in PDX murine models for pancreatic, gastric, ovarian, triple negative breast and lung cancers, with or without humanized immune systems, and showing no significant toxicity. Higher anti-tumoral effect was evidenced over both classical chemotherapy and modern immunotherapy drugs, as a single agent or in combination therapies with Gemcitabine/Abraxane or immune checkpoint inhibitors. OMTX705 even displays superiority compared to other FAP-targeted ADCs bearing different payloads such as deruxtecan in pancreas cancer models. Moreover, it exhibits high plasma stability and excellent safety profile, with no adverse effects observed in non-human primates at doses up to 100 mg/kg. OMTX705 operates through a dual mechanism of action. First, upon ADC internalization, the bystander effect of the payload released from FAP-positive CAFs leads to efficient killing of neighboring tumor cells. This effect has been validated through different experimental techniques in vitro and in preclinical tumor samples. The second mechanism involves immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, further strengthening its therapeutic potential. This dual effect, combined with a favorable safety profile, positions OMTX705 as a promising candidate among cancer therapeutics, targeting the stroma in solid tumors and enhancing antitumor immune responses.Citation Format:Patricia Gonz\u00e1lez, Isabel Ega\u00f1a, Cristina Ferrer, Roland Kontermann, Oliver Seifert, Klaus Pfizenmaier, Wolfgang Richter, Laureano Simon, Myriam Fabre.

    "abstract": "Background:Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have significantly transformed cancer therapy. However, the majority of patients still cannot get benefit from this treatment or may develop resistance afterwards. The increased expression of PD-L1 in tumors makes it an attractive target for ADC development leading to the most advanced program in registration trials. We developed a multi-specific ADC targeting another set of antigens, ITGB6/8. Integrins are cell surface receptors that usually mediate cell to cell adhesion. Integrin \u03b26/8(ITGB6/8), which can only form a heterodimer with the \u03b1v integrin subunit, is highly expressed in various tumors. Utilizing our proprietary site-specific glycan conjugation, we generated JSKN022, an innovative PD-L1/ITGB6/8 targeting ADC, which structurally composed of a sdAb (single domain antibody) Fc fusion protein targeting PD-L1 and ITGB6/8, a cleavable linker and a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor (T01, Alphatecan). In this study, the pharmacological activity of JSKN022 was evaluated using preclinical in vitro and in vivo models.Methods:Based on Envafolimab, we designed a novel sdAb-Fc fusion protein which targeting both PD-L1 and ITGB6/8. Then T01 was homogeneously and stably conjugated to glycan located on Fc. The conjugated product (DAR4) was thoroughly characterized by LC-MS. The binding specificity of JSKN022 and its internalization rate were assessed. Pattern of payload released were analyzed using LC-HRMS. Serum stability was tested across various species. In vitro cell growth inhibition and in vivo antitumor efficacy of JSKN022 were examined using a range of cancer cell lines and CDX models with parental antibody ADC as control.Results:JSKN022 demonstrated specific binding to the \u03b1v\u03b26/8 protein, without cross-reactivity with other members of integrin family. JSKN022 exhibited a consistent DAR4. Bridging ELISA indicated that JSKN022 can simultaneously bind to both PD-L1 and ITGB6/8. Flow cytometry binding assays revealed that JSKN022 possessed a superior binding capacity compared to both parental antibodies. Correspondingly, the naked antibody of JSKN022 showed an increased internalization rate relative to parental antibodies in HCC4006 and BxPC-3 tumor cells. JSKN022 effectively inhibits the proliferation of antigen-positive cancer cells and exhibited enhanced tumor suppression compared to the single-target ADCs. Furthermore, benefiting from glycan conjugation, JSKN022 demonstrated excellent stability in serum from rats, mice, monkeys, and humans, with minimal T01 release.Conclusion:This preclinical study suggests JSKN022, as a first in class multi-specific PD-L1/ITGB6/8 ADC, might potentially bring in novelty in the therapeutic approach for cancers that are refractory or resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.Citation Format:Ting Xu, Ling Wang, Yongli Dong, Chuankun Shan.

    "abstract": "Background:Nectin-4 is a tumor-associated antigen, which was observed in multiple cancer types, including bladder, breast, lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Enfortumab Vedotin (EV) is the first approved nectin-4 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with MMAE as its payload for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma (UC). However, beyond UC, EV hasn\u2019t been approved for other indications. In addition, severe skin adverse reactions were reported in EV-treated patients. There are several new nectin-4 ADCs in development but haven\u2019t entered confirmative clinical studies so far. To overcome the limitations of efficacy and safety, we developed a novel mechanism nectin-4 ADC GLR1059, with a payload that was more effective for potential indications with nectin-4 expression and had lower toxicity, including skin adverse reactions.Methods:For in vitro studies, binding affinity and specificity, internalization, cancer cell killing, bystander effect and serum stability were performed. For in vivo studies, efficacy studies were conducted on cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) of multiple cancer types, e.g. breast cancer (including triple-negative breast cancer), and urothelial carcinoma. Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties were studied in BALB/c mice and tumor-bearing nude mice, and safety studies were conducted in humanized nectin-4 mice.Results:GLR1059 is a nectin-4 ADC composed of a novel humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, a cleavable linker and a microtubule targeting agent (not auristatin derivatives). Moreover, to generate DAR4 ADCs with higher homogeneity, the payload was site-specifically conjugated to the antibody via a disulfide bond bridge. In surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, GLR1059 had strong and specific binding to human nectin-4, and it did not bind to nectin-1, nectin-2, or nectin-3. Furthermore, GLR1059 exhibited efficient internalization and potent activity in nectin-4 expressing cell lines and effective bystander activity. In a panel of CDX models, GLR1059 demonstrated compelling anti-tumor activity across bladder cancer and breast cancer (including TNBC), with tumor growth inhibition rates (TGI) significantly higher than EV (approximately 2-4 times). In the tumor-bearing mice PK study, the Cmax of free payload in tumor tissue was approximately 100-fold higher than that in the blood (131\u00b114ng/g vs 1.04\u00b10.27ng/mL). GLR1059 demonstrated longer survival and less weight loss in the single- and repeated-dose toxicity studies in humanized nectin-4 mice. Notably, GLR1059 significantly reduced the incidence and severity of skin toxicity compared with EV (1/6 vs 6/6).Conclusion:Preclinical data show that GLR1059 has the potential to achieve better efficacy and safety, and the different drug mechanisms provide new options to overcome drug resistance of current nectin-4 ADCs.Citation Format:Jiao Jiao, Yingjie Sun, Jiaxing Wang, Liming Che, Menghan Cui, Wenjie Shao, Hairui Yuan, Yan Huang, Nannan Zhai, Yuling Tang, Xiaomei Zheng, Siyao Li.

    "abstract": "Tissue Factor (TF) is a type I transmembrane protein that is aberrantly expressed in multiple solid tumor indications including cervical, head and neck, non-small cell lung, and pancreatic cancers. Its expression is associated with poor prognosis and has been linked to pro-tumorigenic activities such as metastasis, inflammation, and angiogenesis. Under normal physiological conditions, TF plays an important role in blood clotting and, as such, is broadly expressed in many normal tissues, typically in the subendothelium. Upon endothelial damage, TF can combine with clotting factors in circulation to initiate a coagulation cascade, thus constituting a \"hemostatic envelope\". TF-targeted vedotin ADCs are approved in metastatic cervical cancer and in clinical testing across a range of solid tumor indications. However, toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy, epistasis, and ocular toxicities have been dose-limiting. We have developed STRO-004, a novel TF-targeted ADC with a DAR8 \u03b2-glucoronidase-exatecan linker-payload, with enhanced potency and safety in preclinical models. STRO-004 is a TF-targeted ADC, engineered for a wider therapeutic index. The ADC is constructed on an antibody that has been designed to avoid interference in the blood coagulation pathways, thus reducing the potential risk for bleeding. The anti-TF antibody is conjugated to exatecan, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, via a \u03b2-glucoronidase-cleavable linker (SC3417) at a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8. The drug-linker is site-specifically conjugated to the non-natural amino acid p-azidomethylphenylalanine (pAMF) incorporated at optimized sites within the antibody (Ab) sequence using Xpress CF+TM. In preclinical xenograft models, STRO-004 demonstrates potent, dose-dependent activity from 0.25-7.5 mg/kg, including in models with low and heterogeneous levels of TF expression. STRO-004 was evaluated in patient-derived xenograft (PDx) models of cancers with prevalent TF expression and demonstrated 50% overall response rate and 70% disease control rate across all models after single dose treatment. Exploratory toxicology studies show that STRO-004 has a favorable safety profile in cynomolgous monkeys up to 50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. In circulation, STRO-004 demonstrated extended half-life, low clearance, and stable drug-linkage. Consistent with this finding, only low levels of free exatecan could be detected. Based on these promising preclinical observations, STRO-004 is advancing to IND-enabling studies for the treatment of TF expressing malignancies.Citation Format:Andrew McGeehan, Helena Kiefel, Brian Vuillemenot, Guifen Xu, Sihong Zhou, Grace Lee, Mark Armanini, Xiaofan Li, Krishna Bajjuri, Miao Wen, Cuong Tran, Jeff Hanson, Daniel Calarese, Amandeep Gakhal, Hanspeter Gerber, Werner Rubas, Gang Yin, Alice Yam.

    "abstract": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are transforming the treatment of breast cancer as well as lung, ovarian, and several other cancer indications. ADCs targeting HER2 and TROP2 are currently approved in breast and lung cancer subgroups. Some HER2-targeted therapies are efficacious in breast cancer in newly defined HER2-low and -ultralow subgroups. There has been recent interest and some successes combining ADC\u2019s with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite these successes, tumors still develop resistance through both target-dependent and independent mechanisms. Previously we investigated which ADC\u2019s may be expressed in HER2-positive versus negative breast cancers and adeno versus squamous NSCLC histological subtypes. We have now extended these analyses to explore which ADC\u2019s show the highest relative expression levels in these cancers, co-expression with PD-L1 and expression in HER2-low and -ultralow breast cancer subgroups. Optimized IHC assays for B7-H3, B7-H4, Nectin-4, TROP2, PD-L1 and HER2 on Ventana or Dako automated staining platforms were applied to treatment na\u00efve tumor samples from ER+ BC (n=60), TNBC (n=52) and NSCLC (n=134; adeno and squamous) in tissue microarray format (1mm cores). ADC targets were scored by pathologist-assisted digital image analysis to deliver H-Scores and frequencies of positivity at high, moderate, low and negative expression levels. Diagnostic visual scoring methods were employed for analysis of PD-L1 and HER2 (including addition of ultra-low score for HER2). We demonstrate that immune positivity for PD-L1 (CPS >10) was most frequent in HER2-low TNBC compared with HER2-ultralow or negative samples, and that B7-H3 and Nectin-4 H-Scores were higher in TNBC compared with ER+ BC, regardless of PD-L1+ status suggesting potential for immunotherapy combinations in TNBC and especially HER2-low subtype. Furthermore, B7-H4 H-Scores were higher in HER2-low, ultralow and negative ER+ BC compared with HER2 positive samples, while the inverse was observed for B7-H3 revealing potential opportunities for therapies that may overcome resistance to HER2-targeted therapies in this cancer subtype. Squamous NSCLC displayed higher B7-H3 and B7-H4 H-Scores and percent positive cells compared with adeno subtype, and B7-H3 and B7-H4 H-Scores were higher in PD-L1 positive samples (TPS\u22651%) supporting ADC therapy for these targets in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies. Taken together, these data may aid the future selection of targets for upcoming therapeutics that can overcome target-independent resistance and provide rationale for immunotherapy combinations.Citation Format:Marie Cumberbatch, Woo Ho Kim, Milan Bhagat, John Cogswell.

AZD5335, an FR\u03b1-targeting antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (TOP1i) payload, is currently being investigated in the FONTANA Phase I/IIa clinical trial (NCT#05797168), either as a single agent or in combination with a PARP1-selective inhibitor (saruparib). Using an FR\u03b1-expressing EOC xenograft model (OV90), we evaluate additional AZD5335-relevant combined treatment strategies and report pre-clinical assessment of AZD5335 in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and/or carboplatin. Compared to monotherapy treatment, we successfully demonstrate that combination treatments with AZD5335+bevacizumab, AZD5335+paclitaxel or AZD5335+carboplatin result in significant and durable anti-tumor responses. Using the same EOC xenograft model, we extended these studies to include AZD5335+bevacizumab plus either paclitaxel or carboplatin treatments and demonstrated that these triplet combos resulted in superior and durable anti-tumor activities. Combination data in a number of additional CDX/PDX will be presented. A series of in vitro studies will also define the ADC/SOC drug interactions and further delineate underlying mechanisms driving enhanced efficacy. These studies inform our ongoing clinical development of AZD5335 in ovarian cancer.Citation Format:Jason J.

    "abstract": "CEACAM5 (CEA) is a cell surface glycoprotein highly expressed in many cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer (GC), lung and pancreatic cancers. BG-C477 is a novel ADC that is composed of a CEACAM5-specific antibody conjugated to Top1i payloads (drug-to-antibody ratio = 8) via a cleavable linker. It remains stable in human plasma and mice blood circulation. BG-C477 showed specific binding to CEA-expressing MKN45 cells and stronger internalization activity compared to anti-CEA DM4 ADC. BG-C477 exhibited robust and CEA-dependent cytotoxicity in cell lines with different CEA expression levels. A potent bystander effect of BG-C477 was observed in co-culture killing assay with mixed CEA-positive MKN45 and -negative HCT116 cells, indicating the potential to treat tumors with heterogeneous CEA expression. In the animal studies, BG-C477 demonstrated potent and dose-associated single-agent efficacy in multiple CEA-expressing cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Moreover, BG-C477 exhibited superior antitumor efficacy in GC and CRC PDX models that anti-CEA DM4 ADC was ineffective.In summary, BG-C477 is a promising CEA targeting ADC with great anti-tumor activity across multiple types of tumors. The first in human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BG-C477 is ongoing (NCT06596473).Citation Format:Daochuan He, Yiren Xiao, Zhuo Li, Jie Li, Hongyu Chen, Weijie Li, Huang Yan, Kunji Liu, Yang Lyu, Qingsong Hu, Mengjia Wang, Lai Xu, Zhitao Wan, Xiaomin Song, Yu Shen, Lai Wang.

    "abstract": "TROP2 is frequently overexpressed in a number of epithelial cancers, and therapeutics targeting TROP2 has demonstrated clinical efficacy in multiple indications, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), HR+/HER2- breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its broad expression in normal tissues raises the risk of on-target and off-tumor toxicity, potentially limiting the therapeutic effectiveness. PTK7 has emerged as an alternative target, exhibiting high prevalence and overexpression in a variety of tumors, such as TNBC, NSCLC, ovarian, oesophageal and colorectal cancers.BCG033 is a bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets both PTK7 and TROP2, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy while reducing the off-target effects. Developed using Biocytogen\u2019s fully human common light chain RenLite\u00ae mice, BCG033 is conjugated with BLD1102--a novel linker/payload containing a DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitor paired with a highly hydrophilic, protease-cleavable linker, achieving an optimal drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 8.Structurally, the backbone of BCG033 consists of a bivalent antibody with two monovalent components that separately target PTK7 and TROP2, which are engineered to minimize internalization and improve tumor selectivity. BCG033 backbone antibody demonstrates strong binding activity under varying PTK7 and TROP2 expression levels in tumors, and exhibits promising developability under stress force degradation.In proof of concept studies, BCG033 AB-vcMMAE showed synergistic effect and enhanced activity compared to the parental ADCs in both cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC, even with low PTK7 expression. When conjugated with Biocytogen\u2019s linker/payload BLD1102, BCG033 demonstrated superior efficacy across varying PTK7 and TROP2 expression levels in PDX models and consistently outperformed benchmark ADCs in multiple tumor models, including NSCLC, TNBC, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer.In summary, BCG033 demonstrates promising potential for delivering potent and broad anti-tumor activity across a range of solid tumors, offering broad clinical application opportunities.Citation Format:Lillian Ma, Na Zhang, Chengzhang Shang, Yi Yang.

    "abstract": "HER3 has emerged as a critical player in the resistance mechanisms against therapies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Its upregulation can activate alternative signaling pathways, enabling cancer cells to bypass the effects of EGFR inhibitors, which often results in treatment failure. To combat this issue, novel HER3-targeting therapies are under investigation, including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as Patritumab Deruxtecan (U3-1402), which have shown encouraging results in clinical trials, underscoring the potential of HER3 targeting to overcome resistance. The development of bispecific ADCs that target both HER3 and EGFR represents a pioneering approach that may enhance therapeutic efficacy through dual targeting. Izalonatamab brengitecan (BL-B01D1), an ADC designed for simultaneous targeting of EGFR and HER3, has demonstrated substantial clinical benefits in heavily pretreated patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Building on this strategy, we are advancing a novel bispecific ADC, BR-2302, which employs a human IgG1 format bi-specific antibody with high affinity for HER3 and moderate affinity for EGFR. This innovative design aims to maximize therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing on-target/off-tumor toxicity associated with the widespread expression of EGFR in normal tissues. Our comprehensive studies on BR-2302 have focused on its in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo tumor inhibitory effects across various cancer cell lines and xenograft models expressing the target antigens. BR-2302 exhibited significant anti-tumor activity in vitro, achieving subnanomolar IC50 values against HER3-expressing cell lines regardless of their EGFR expression levels. in vivo experiments demonstrated remarkable tumor growth inhibition and sustained regression in human lung and colon cancer xenograft models, surpassing the tumor inhibitory effects of established benchmark ADCs. Collectively, our findings indicate that BR-2302 possesses promising anti-tumor properties. This innovative therapeutic approach has the potential to improve treatment outcomes for patients with solid tumors expressing both HER3 and EGFR, warranting further clinical exploration.Citation Format:Yang Wang, Bing Xia, Lixia Cao, Jianfeng Yang, Cui Feng, Fangdun Jiang, Chen Li, Lixia Gu, Yifan Yang, Jing Tian, Jiasheng Geng, Qi Zhang, Ziping Wei, Yuhong Zhou.

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of immunotherapeutics permitting the delivery of therapeutics with sufficient potency and specificity by doing so systemic toxicity typical of conventional chemotherapy is minimized. However, the challenges in controlling their internalization have posed a hurdle in maximizing the therapeutic potential of ADCs. Here we present a novel FcBP-based modality called FcBC17, an FcBP coupled with an extracellular matrix (ECM)-binding moiety, which plays an ADC enhancer by improving the cell binding and internalization of ADCs through a biologically active mechanism. FcBC17 comprises an FcBP, a linker, and an ECM-binding peptide and tightly associates with IgG antibodies. The efficacy of FcBC17 was demonstrated using PAb001, a humanized IgG1 antibody targeting MUC1-C developed by Peptron. Due to its reversible binding to the Fc-region of PAb001, the structural and functional integrity of PAb001 remains and also additional effort to modify PAb001 is unnecessary, representing a simple, broadly applicable strategy to enable antibody delivery into cells. We show that FcBC17 improved cell binding of PAb001 in diverse cancer cells with different levels of MUC1. In addition, PAb001-FcBC17 conjugate showed a better internalization in cancer cells and intriguingly, a biologically active mechanism such as endocytosis seemed to mediate the internalization, suggesting that FcBC17 might enhance the cytotoxicity of PAb001-ADC (PAb001-MMAE or PAb001-DXd) through enhancing its cell binding and internalization actively. Indeed, the cytotoxicity of PAb001-ADC was greatly improved with the conjugation of FcBC17 against cancer cells that otherwise showed a poor IC50 with the treatment of PAb001-ADC, and no cytotoxicity was observed with the treatment of FcBC17 alone, indicating that the ADC enhancement was likely due to the improved internalization of PAb001-ADC through the conjugation of FcBC17. Moreover, due to the nature of FcBP whose binding is separated on acidic pH conditions, PAb001-FcBC17 conjugate remains stable under normal physiological conditions, ensuring that the efficacy of PAb001-ADC is not compromised upon clinical treatment. In conclusion, the binding and internalization of PAb001-ADC on cancer cells could be greatly enhanced with the conjugation of FcBC17 which in turn has resulted in the dramatic improvement of the cytotoxicity mediated with PAb001-ADC, implying that the critical limitation of conventional ADCs in controlling cellular internalization may be ameliorated through our FcBP-based approach. The versatility of our approach as an ADC enhancer will be further demonstrated across various applications, not only in targeting MUC1-expressing tumors but also in treating other types of cancers and malignancies through diverse therapeutic antibody formats.Citation Format:Dae Young Kim, Yujin Park, Dahye Sim, Hana Kang, Sung Min Kim, Yejin Bang, Hee Young Kang, Hoil Choi.

    "abstract": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a unique therapeutic combination of the tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody, high-potency cytotoxic drug, and a chemical linker. Together, these components enable the tumor-specific delivery of the highly potent cytotoxin. However, treatment efficacy is often limited by on-target/off-tumor toxicity due to antigen expression in healthy tissue and by unwanted payload release outside the tumor caused by linker cleavage via circulating proteases. In this study, we present BA3361, a NextGen ADC featuring a conditionally active biologics (CAB) anti-Nectin4-ADC, optimized with novel CAB and linker technologies. BA3361 demonstrates pH-selective enhanced target binding in the tumor microenvironment conditions, improved serum stability, increased solubility, and tumor-specific payload release. These advancements effectively address critical clinical challenges by reducing off-tumor, on-target and off-target toxicities. In vivo efficacy data showed complete tumor regression in several patient derived cancer models. Notably, compared to an Enfortumab vedotin analogue, superior efficacy was observed in patient-derived pancreatic xenograft models, and the in vivo potency was tightly correlated with target expression. Furthermore, we discovered that intracellular glycosidase activity is high in pancreatic tumor tissue, independent of target expression, indicating efficient tumor selective linker cleavage. In conclusion, our NextGen Nectin4-CAB-ADC BA3361 demonstrates comparable or superior activity in lung, breast, and urothelial patient derived cancer models compared to Enfortumab vedotin and outperforms it in pancreatic PDX models. In addition, the conditional binding in the TME should help to reduce side effects of nonCAB ADCs and potentially widen the therapeutic index.Citation Format:Jing Wang, Jian Chen, Gerhard Frey, Haizhen Liu, Cathy Chang, William J.

    "abstract": "Current ADCs typically rely on intracellular drug release. However, the number of suitable internalizing receptors in solid cancers is limited while there are suitable non-internalizing tumor markers, provided effective extracellular cleavage can be achieved. To expand the ADC target scope, Tagworks is pioneering a radically new approach to ADCs based on its Click-to-Release platform, which centers on selective payload release from a trans-cyclooctene (TCO) linker upon click reaction with a tetrazine molecule (the trigger). In this approach, following tumor accumulation and blood clearance of the click-cleavable ADC, a tetrazine trigger molecule is administered i.v. that rapidly releases the payload from the extracellular ADC, allowing it to distribute into surrounding cells, maximizing the bystander effect. The first in class click-cleavable ADC therapy TGW101 combines a tetrazine trigger (TRG001) with a click-cleavable ADC, TGW101-ADC, targeting non-internalizing tumor marker TAG72, expressed by many adenocarcinomas. The ADC comprises a 60 kD diabody, site specifically conjugated with TCO-linked MMAE at a drug to antibody ratio of 3.8. TGW101 uses a new TCO / tetrazine combination with 100-fold higher reactivity than in previous versions, allowing markedly lower trigger doses, as low as 3 mg/kg, for complete ADC conversion in mice. The purpose of this study was to characterize the anticancer activity of TGW101, and its tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) in the rat and non-human primate (NHP). In vitro, TGW101-ADC showed fast and quantitative release of MMAE upon reaction with TRG001. Cell killing was dependent on binding to TAG72 on the cell and extracellular reaction with TRG001. In vivo, TGW101 gave high and stable free intratumor MMAE concentrations (300 nM at 2 mg/kg ADC) and showed strong dose dependent activity in several TAG72-positive xenografts in single and repeated cycles, using a 2-day interval between TGW101-ADC and TRG001, without TGW101-related toxicity. TGW101-ADC alone was stable and very well tolerated in NHPs at repeated doses at 50 mg/kg (NOAEL) with a clearance half-life of 25h. Similarly, TRG001 was very well tolerated, with HNSTD/NOAEL of 700 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg in rat and NHP, respectively, with a half-life of 0.6h in NHP. When used in combination in NHPs, biweekly cycles of ADC followed 4 days later by a high dose of trigger (75 mg/kg) afforded an HNSTD of 5 mg/kg for TGW101-ADC (which equates to 12.5 mg/kg for mAb size), with reversible and non-adverse effects consistent with free MMAE released from residual circulating ADC by Trigger. In conclusion, TGW101 demonstrated potent and specific in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity, while it was well tolerated in rats and NHPs at doses at or higher than current MMAE ADCs. This warrants clinical development of this promising click-cleavable ADC with the aim to expand the ADC target scope.Citation Format:Raffaella Rossin, Martijn H. den Brok, Lieke W.

    "abstract": "Introduction:The three essential components of an ADC include the mAb, the linker, and the cytotoxic payload. The mAb is designated to target specific tumor-associated antigens that are overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells. The mAb PB-223 was developed through the affinity maturation of mAb NEO-102, a chimeric human IgG1 mAb that specifically targets truncated Core-2 O-glycans, found in colorectal and pancreatic cancers. The binding affinity of PB-223 for its target was improved, compared to NEO-102, by optimizing its VH and VL sequences through Fast Screening for Expression Biophysical Properties and Affinity. PB-223 demonstrated a binding affinity (KD) at least 4-fold lower than NEO-102, indicating stronger tumor binding. IHC analysis also revealed that PB-223 binds to a wider spectrum of tumor tissues compared to NEO-102, but not to normal tissues. PB-223 can be internalized into human cancer cell lines expressing its target. The objective of this study is to develop an ADC utilizing PB-223 for treatment of various human malignancies.Experimental Design:PB-223 was used for the development of the ADC. Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) was used as payload, with mc-vc-PABc serving as the linker. PB-223 was conjugated to the linker-payload through a cysteine-based conjugation method. Drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) was measured using Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)-MS. Flow cytometry was used for binding assessment of the ADC using the ovarian cancer cell line OV90 as the target. Cytotoxicity of the ADC was evaluated through cell viability assays using CellTiter-Glo cell viability Kit using OV90.as target.Results:Three ADCs were developed: PB-MMAE-2, PB-MMAE-5 and PB-MMAE-6. The DAR for these ADCs were 3.72, 3.92 and 4.15 respectively. We analyzed their target binding capabilities in comparison to PB-223. The results indicated that all three ADCs exhibit similar binding affinity to PB-223. The cytotoxicity of the ADCs was evaluated using the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 with Trastuzumab deruxtecan ADC (DS-8201) as positive control. At a concentration of 10nM, DS-8201 inhibited cell proliferation by 82.39%. All three PB-223 ADC effectively killed OV90 cells. At a concentration of 333nM, the percentage of cell killing for PB-MMAE-2, PB-MMAE-5 and PB-MMAE-6 was 82.91%, 84.04% and 83.16%, respectively. In contrast, both human IgG1 and naked PB-223 mAb showed no killing of OV90 cells.Conclusions:In this study, we developed PB-223 ADCs and evaluated their anti-tumor efficacy using an in vitro model. We assessed three PB-223 ADCs: PB-MMAE-2, PB-MMAE-5 and PB-MMAE-6. Our findings highlight the potential of these ADCs as innovative options for treating human carcinomas expressing core 2 O-glycans. Further In vivo studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are ongoing.Citation Format:Kwong Y. Tsang, Massimo Fantini, Anjum Zaki, Sharon A. Mavroukakis, Philip M. Arlen.

    "abstract": "Background:Cadherin is a superfamily of cell adhesion molecules that depend on Ca2+ and play an important role in maintaining tissue architecture. Abnormal expression of Cadherins is often associated with malformation of tissues, tumor formation, and metastasis. Cadherin-17 (CDH17) also known as hepatocyte-enterocyte cadherin, is a non-classical member of the calcium-dependent cadherin superfamily. Unlike classical cadherins, the CDH17 sequence is formed by seven extracellular calcium-dependent cadherin domains and a very short cytoplasmic domain. CDH17 is a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates cell-cell adhesion in intestinal epithelial cells. Studies have found that CDH17 expression is limited to the intestinal and pancreatic duct epithelial cells in human normal tissues. However, in tumor tissues, CDH17 is highly expressed in various digestive tract tumors, such as gastric cancer (73%), colorectal cancer (100%) and pancreatic cancer (31%). Some studies have also reported positive staining for CDH17 in about 6% of lung cancer patients, 11% of ovarian cancer patients, and 2% of liver cancer patients. These results suggest that CDH17 may be a potential therapeutic target in related tumors, especially digestive tract tumors.Methods& Results: We developed a novel CDH17-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) called SCR-A008, which is comprised of an anti-CDH17 humanized monoclonal antibody conjugated with novel topoisomerase 1 inhibitor (CPT116) via a hydrophilic cleavable linker at DAR 8. SCR-A008 specifically recognizes human and cyno CDH17 with high affinity. In vitro cytotoxicity experiment demonstrated that SCR-A008 induced tumor cell lysis in various tumor cell type. Compared to MMAE-based CDH17-ADC, SCR-A008 exhibits significantly stronger anti-tumor activity in colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, we utilized CDX and PDX model to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of SCR-A008. The results showed that SCR-A008 inhibited tumor growth of various tumors in a dose dependent manner. SCR-A008 also have good stability and favorable developability. Pharmacokinetics and tolerability were assessed in mouse and cynomolgus monkey. The pharmacokinetics experiment in mice showed better PK characteristic than the reference ADC.Conclusion:These findings suggest that SCR-A008 is a potential Best-in-Class therapeutic drug for CDH17-positive solid tumor.Citation Format:Guangcun Cheng, Hui Zheng, Zhiyong Yu, Chunlei Xia, Huipeng Guo, Xiyuan Wang, Yayuan Fu, Renhong Tang.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), increased CD37 expression on blasts and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) has also been reported, both at protein and mRNA levels. This increased expression is restricted to malignant cells compared to hematopoietic stem cells and correlates with poor patient outcome.We confirmed broad expression of CD37 across patients in 53 AML and 15 MDS primary samples and observed a strong internalization capability particularly suitable for an ADC therapy. Debio 1562M, a 2nd generation CD37-targeting ADC, is active at sub-nanomolar level across all AML models evaluated, irrespective of their treatment history, physiological subtype, genetic alterations, or mutation background. Sensitivity to Debio 1562M was not correlated with CD37 expression level suggesting a development in all comer\u2019s population.We assessed the effect of Debio 1562M on LSCs derived from 14 primary AML samples, where a 10nM treatment was able to decrease the number of colony formation by 80% compared to control. Additionally, we confirmed the capacity of Debio 1562M to reach tumor cells present in the bone marrow (BM) of NSG mice inoculated with MOLM-13 AML cells, suggesting that tumor cells in the BM can be targeted by Debio 1562M to allow LSCs elimination. Debio 1562M activity was benchmarked against several targeted therapies such as menin, FLT3, IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors or gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) CD33-targeting ADC, in different in vivo models. In MOLM-13 xenografted mice, Debio 1562M induced tumor regression after a single injection similarly to GO, while the menin inhibitor revumenib achieved tumor stasis with twice daily administrations and the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib only achieved partial response after daily administrations. Similarly, in 4 patient-derived xenograft models bearing FLT3, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, Debio 1562M led to greater circulating blast reduction compared to gilteritinib, ivosidenib IDH1 inhibitor and enasidenib IDH2 inhibitor. In summary, Debio 1562M monotherapy shows superior activity than targeted therapies in preclinical AML models.The toxicological profile of Debio 1562M in mice showed expected off-target toxicity related to the payload\u2019s activity. On-target toxicity profile of Debio 1562M could not be evaluated due to lack of cross-reactive species, however no significant toxicity on human PBMCs was observed in vitro. In conclusion, the promising antitumor activity and tolerability of Debio 1562M in preclinical models pave the way for entering clinical development in AML in 2025.Citation Format:Lisa Ivanschitz, Jos\u00e9e Hue-Perron, Alain Monjardet, Noemie Luong, Esthela Artiga, Karilyn T.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a breakthrough therapeutic class that provides tumor-targeted cytotoxicity while stimulating immune responses, offering promising potential when combined with immunotherapies and particularly with PD-1 inhibitors. Traditional xenograft tumor models developed in immunodeficient mice are employed to evaluate ADCs' anti-tumor efficacy. However, these models lack competent immune systems and human antigen expression in normal tissues, limiting their capacity to assess immune responses and toxicity. To address these limitations, we developed HuCell, mouse tumor cells engineered to express tumor associated antigen (hTAA) such as HER2, and HuGEMM, humanized for a specific drug target within mice with a functional immune system. In this study HuCell/HuGEMM humanized mouse models were developed to evaluate the efficacy of ADCs in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and toxicity.Methods:Surface expression of human HER2, Trop2, and Nectin-4 on MC-38 HuCell was verified using flow cytometry before and after inoculation on mice. 5\u00d7106 HuCells were subcutaneously inoculated into hHER2, hTrop2, hNectin4 and hHER2/hPD-1 models in C57BL/6 background or wild-type (WT) models. Tumor-bearing models were treated with monotherapy of trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-Dxd), sacituzumab govitecan or enfortumab vedotin, or combination therapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies. For the toxicity study, 180 mg/kg T-Dxd and 100 mg/kg trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) were injected into hHER2 mice weekly for two doses by intravenous injection.Results:A highly HER2-expressing HuCell line (clone #2) successfully grew in hHER2 models but not in WT models, with tumors displaying nearly 100% of human Her2 positive cells with high surface expression (2\u00d7105 molecules per cell). In dose response study, T-Dxd significantly inhibited tumor growth at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg in C57BL/6-hHER2. Combination treatment of T-Dxd (4 mg/kg+2 mg/kg, QW) with Keytruda (5 mg/kg, BIW\u00d72) resulted in a complete response rate (8/8) with 87% TGI (p<0.01) compared to T-Dxd monotherapy (7/8) with 96% TGI (p<0.001) in hHER2/PD-1 double knock in mice. In a toxicity study, T-DM1 showed liver toxicity, whereas T-Dxd did not. Both T-DM1 and T-Dxd exhibited notable hematological toxicity, consistent with clinical observations. In the Trop2 and Nectin-4 HuCell/HuGEMM studies, similar results were observed. HuGEMM models demonstrated superior positive cell rate and single-cell antigen expression levels. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was observed when PD-1 therapy was combined with monotherapy.Conclusion:HuCell and HuGEMM models provide an advanced platform to evaluate ADC drug monotherapy and combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, they offer a sophisticated solution to assess both on-target and off-target toxicity of ADCs.Citation Format:Xiaoze Wang, Rong Wang, Kaixia Lian, Rongfei Lu, Jian Feng, Jun Zhou, Xiaolong Tu, Xinhe Feng, Jie Lin, Fuping Xu, Ludovic Bourre, Jingjing Wang.

    "abstract": "Background:LIV-1, also known as SLC39A6 or ZIP6, a multi- transmembrane protein with putative zinc transporter and metalloproteinase activity. LIV-1 is expressed in a number of cancers with the highest prevalence in breast, prostate, ovary and melanoma, but a limited presence in vital organs. Currently, the clinical-stage ADC drug targeting LIV-1, Ladiratuzumab vedotin (SGN-LIV1A), is undergoing Phase 2 trials and has demonstrated clinical benefits, thus further underscoring LIV-1 as a promising target for advanced solid tumors. Given the broad spectrum of tumor indications addressable by targeting LIV-1, we utilized Simcere Zaiming\u2019 proprietary ADC technology to generate a novel ADC targeted to LIV-1 named SCR-A003.Method:SCR-A003 is comprised of a LIV-1-targeted monoclonal antibody linked to a novel cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor by a protease-cleavable linker. Pharmacokinetic study was conducted in mice in which SCR-A003 administered IV infusion. In vivo efficacy studies were conducted in immunodeficient mice with human tumor cell-lines including NCI-H838 and OVCAR3.The anti-tumor efficacy of SCR-A003 was evaluated in comparison to SGN-LIV1A analogue.Result:SCR-A003 had highly specific binding affinity with human and could cross-bind to cyno LIV-1. Moreover, SCR-A003 exhibited excellent internalization and cell killing ability on multiple tumor cells in-vitro assay. SCR-A003, demonstrated specific, dose-dependent in vivo antitumor activity toward LIV-1-positive tumor xenografts representing lung, ovary and breast cancers. Compared to SGN-LIV1A analogue, SCR-A003 exhibited more robust tumor inhibition capacity at lower doses in OVCAR3 and NCI-H838 xenograft models. Additionally, SCR-A003 also showed prolonged serum half-life and higher drug exposure than SGN-LIV1A analogue in pharmacokinetic study.Conclusions:SCR-A003, exhibited a favorable preclinical profile, with potent in vivo activity toward LIV-1-expressing tumor xenografts representing a range of cancer indications. These data support clinical development of SCR-A003 for the treatment of LIV-1-expressing solid cancers.Citation Format:Yayuan Fu, Changyan Chen, Xiaohua Yan, Zhiyong Yu, Zhuangzhi Zhao, Jingli Liao, Zhenyun Tian, Renhong Tang.

    "abstract": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, is highly and specifically expressed in prostate cancer while showing limited expression in normal tissues. The FDA\u2019s approval of (177) Lu-PSMA-617 has validated PSMA as a therapeutic target for treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we present the development and preclinical characterization of MHB048C, a novel PSMA specific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC).MHB048C comprises a human IgG1 antibody against PSMA, conjugated to the SuperTopoiTM payload, a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor that is 3\u223c5 times more potent than DXd. The drug-antibody ratio is approximately 4.0. Fc function was silenced to minimize nonspecific ADC uptake, and the linker was designed to enhance hydrophilicity and prevent the retro-Michael reaction, improving plasma stability. The antibody preferentially binds to the PSMA dimer rather than the monomer, as only dimers display the native conformation. MHB048C showed strong binding affinity in protein and cell-level assays and was efficiently internalized by LNCaP cells, reaching an internalization rate of \u223c70% within 1 hour. It exhibited potent cytotoxicity in PSMA-positive prostate cancer cell lines with varying PSMA expression levels and demonstrated significant antitumor activity in an LNCaP FGC prostate cancer xenograft model. In GLP monkey studies, MHB048C exhibited a favorable safety profile with no off-target toxicities. The highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was determined to be 45 mg/kg Q3W, the maximum dose tested.In conclusion, MHB048C demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, along with a favorable safety profile, supporting advancement to clinical development.Citation Format:Yile Chen, Ao Li, Bo Liu, Liyuan Zhu, Xiang Meng, Zhili Yao, Yan Wang, Xialian Weng, Xuefeng Zhu, Shiyu Zhou, Junwei Shi, Guoqing Cao.

    "abstract": "Background:AZD9592 is a bispecific ADC designed to target both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition tyrosine kinase receptor (cMET), delivering a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload to tumor cells. Despite recent advances in ADC development for CRC, such as the use of trastuzumab deruxtecan to treat HER2-positive CRC, a significant unmet need remains for novel therapeutic approaches, particularly for patients with limited targeted treatment options.Methods:We evaluated the antitumor efficacy of AZD9592 and explored biomarker-response relationships in CRC PDX models across a range of very low to high EGFR expression (optical density of membrane [OD] 6.7-162.6) and cMET expression (OD 18.5-142.6) measured by immunohistochemistry-quantitative continuous score (IHC-QCS), as well as other molecular features like oncogene drivers. Responses were defined as \u226530% tumor volume reductions from baseline.Results:AZD9592 demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy, with responses observed in 34.5% of models at 8 mg/kg and 14.8% at 4 mg/kg. Biomarker analyses of tumors revealed a significant association between cMET expression levels by IHC-QCS and responses at 8 mg/kg. cMET levels were significantly higher in AZD9592-responsive models than in antibody-responsive and isotype control-responsive models (p<0.02 for both). An optimized cMET expression cutoff had a predictive performance with an area under the curve of 0.73. Compared to wildtype tumors, response rates were not significantly different in tumors harboring mutations in oncogenes that share signaling pathways with EGFR and cMET and where clinical activity of EGFR antibody therapies is limited, including KRAS and BRAF. Moreover, response rates were not significantly different across tumors derived from patients with or without prior irinotecan treatment, a chemotherapy that also inhibits topoisomerase I. Proteomics identified additional molecular features associated with response.Conclusions:AZD9592 demonstrated dose-dependent antitumor activity in CRC PDX models, including KRAS-mutant and KRAS-wildtype tumors. These responses suggest opportunities for clinical development of AZD9592 in CRC and the potential for biomarker-guided patient selection.Citation Format:Ying Zheng, Edward Rosfjord, Simon Christ, Stephanie Zalesak-Kravec, Italia Grenga, Fernanda Arnaldez, Frank Comer, Lara McGrath.

    "abstract": "Instruction:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a rapidly advancing therapeutic approach. A proof of principle CADM1 ADC has shown significant efficacy in osteosarcoma preclinical studies; however, its activity may be compromised by inherent or acquired resistance during prolonged treatment. In this study we generated osteosarcoma models resistant to a CADM1 ADC to define the underlying molecular mechanisms.Methods:The antitumor efficacy of CADM1 ADC was validated in vivo in six osteosarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) at a 3 mg/kg dose. To model acquired resistance, osteosarcoma PDXs were subjected to three cycles of treatment with a low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) CADM1 ADC. Tumor samples were harvested from pre-treated controls and post-treatment resistant PDXs. These samples were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Resistant PDXs were further tested with two alternative ADCs: one using the same payload but targeting a different antigen and another using the same target antigen but with a different payload. IC50 values were determined in pre-treated and resistant PDX-derived cells to evaluate cytotoxicity.Results:After three cycles of low-dose CADM1 ADC treatment, PDX models exhibited a gradual decline in tumor regression, indicating the development of resistance. IHC and flow cytometry analyses demonstrated variable CADM1 expression between pre-treatment and resistant samples, with only some tumors exhibiting decreased target expression. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) revealed increased gene copy number gains in resistant tumors compared to controls. RNA-seq analysis identified significant changes in gene expression, including reduced CADM1 expression in some samples and upregulation of resistance-associated pathways. Notably, the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) transporter ABCC3 was significantly overexpressed in resistant tumors compared to pre-treatment samples. Cytotoxicity assays further confirmed resistance, with resistant PDX-derived cells exhibiting higher IC50 values compared to pre-treated cells, indicating reduced sensitivity to CADM1 ADC.Conclusions:CADM1 ADC demonstrates potent antitumor activity in osteosarcoma PDX models but resistance can develop. Future studies will delve deeper into protein localization and post-translational modifications as well as single cell genomics to better understand the mechanisms of resistance.Citation Format:Zhongting Zhang, Wendong Zhang, Xin Zhou, Caterina Longo, Yifei Wang, Dongxue Mao, Yanhua Yi, Zhaohui Xu, Zhao Li, Simon Olivares, Sylvester Jusu, Harjeet Singh, Michael Roth, Jonathan Gill, Bissan Al-Lazikani, Richard Gorlick.

This study presents an ADC testing platform, leveraging patient-derived organoids (PDO) and advanced 3D high-content imaging.Methods:The efficacy of FDA-approved ADC Sacituzumab Govitecan/SN38 (SG), was evaluated in the CellTiter-Glo (CTG)-based OrganoidXplore panel, a 3D in vitro screening panel of 50 organoid models across 7 indications. The panel was characterized by NGS (WES, RNAseq) but selected without bias for TROP2/TACSTD2 expression. The OrganoidXplore screen was followed up with validating SG and payload responses using CTG and high-content imaging (HCI). ADC target engagement was assessed via immunofluorescence (IF) and ADC responses were validated in a selection of in vivo PDX models.Results:SG demonstrated a broad differential response (<0.01nM<IC50<50nM) in the OrganoidXplore panel, with 18 models showing strong responses (IC50<0.01nM). Response rates did not correlate with mRNA expression TROP2/TACSTD2. IF staining of the original PDX tumor tissues and organoids confirmed the correspondence between TROP2/TACSTD2 mRNA and protein expression levels, reaffirming that SG sensitivity did not directly correlate with gene and protein expression. Additional studies were performed with SG and SN38 in selected resistant and sensitive organoid models by HCI analysis. Similarly to the CTG assay, TROP2/TACSTD2 protein expression did not correlate with increased SG efficacy, showing that PDO sensitivity was not primarily driven by absolute target levels but rather through the mode of action of ADC uptake and payload sensitivity. Preliminary in vivo ADC efficacy results supported the in vitro findings.Conclusion:The OrganoidXplore screening platform provides insights into ADC efficacy, and responses and target engagement were validated with HCI. Combined, this demonstrates a lack of correlation between target expression (mRNA and protein) and drug efficacy, and the importance of functional testing for efficacy across a diverse patient population. The unique application of the 3D HCI platform for additional characterization, including ADC binding and uptake assays, will be an essential step to gain insight into the mode of action requirements for ADCs to be effective. These findings highlight the application of functional screening in organoid to better understand the complexity of ADC efficacy and identify responder/non-responder patient profiles to guide on resistance mechanism, in vivo modeling, and biomarker identification for patient stratification.Citation Format:Marten Hornsveld, Jinxi Wang, Jun Zhou, Xiaolong Tu, Peter van Schaik, Mariusz Madej, Hester Bange, Jessie J.J.

    "abstract": "Several promising therapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) targeting specific genetic and epigenetic mutations have been reported. However, there remains a critical need for novel therapies with higher efficacy and favorable safety profiles particularly for patients with poor-risk cytogenetic features, such as TP53 mutation, or those with relapsed and refractory AML. G1 to S phase transition 1 (GSPT1) is a small GTPase that interacts with eRF1, the translation termination factor, to facilitate the process of translation termination. GSPT1 has been well known to play a critical role in the proliferation of AML and MYC-driven lung cancer. Recently, molecular glue degraders (MGDs) targeting GSPT1 have emerged as a new class of cancer therapies and have shown early promise in clinical trials for AML. However, clinical development of GSPT1 MGDs, such as CC-885 and CC-90009, has been hampered by off-target toxicities. To improve both target specificity and the therapeutic window, we discovered TRX-214-1002, a CD33-targeting ADC that used the same monoclonal antibody (mAb) as Mylotarg, conjugated with a novel proprietary GSPT1 MGD as the payload. The in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of TRX-214-1002 were compared with ORM-6151 (another GSPT1 MG degrader-based CD33 ADC) and Mylotarg. TRX-214-1002 demonstrated superior and sustained degradability against GSPT1 compared to ORM-6151, and it exhibited potent anti-leukemic activity with picomolar GI50 values in TP53 or FLT3 mutated AML cell lines. Importantly, it highly spared CD33-negative leukemia cell and human PBMC, with an in vitro therapeutic index greater than 100-fold. We also observed that TRX-214-1002 significantly upregulated integrated stress response markers (ATF4, CHOP, ATF3) and impaired neo-protein synthesis, consistent with apoptosis induction. Interestingly, TRX-214-1002 maintained potent anti-leukemic activity even in venetoclax-resistant HL-60 cells and in drug-resistant milieu derived from bone marrow stromal HS-5 cells. Furthermore, a single 1 mg/kg dose of TRX-214-1002 completely regressed tumors in MV4-11 and HL-60 xenograft models without tumor regrowth until day 42, whereas the ORM-6151-treated group led to transient tumor regression. Pharmacodynamic studies in the HL-60 tumor model showed dose-dependent degradation of GSPT1. In addition, we estimated that the minimum therapeutically effective dose was less than single 1 mg/kg in a disseminated tumor model. Collectively, TRX-214-1002 highlighted the noticeable GSPT1 degradability and enhanced antileukemic activity, particularly in TP53 mutated and venetoclax-resistant AML cell lines, along with significant antitumor activity superior to competitor ADCs. Our preclinical data suggest that TRX-214-1002 has the high potential to provide a novel treatment strategy for CD33 positive relapse/refractory AML patients.Citation Format:Hee Kyu Lee, Seongrak Kim, Dohoon Kim, Seulgi Choi, Jookyung Lee, Sungwon Lee, Eunhyun Choi, Sang Won Park, Kwangwoo Chun, Koo Lee.

    "abstract": "Background:AMB304 is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) combining a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody and a high efficacious topoisomerase I inhibitor (Topo I) payload with site-specific conjugation. The target of AMB304 is a cell surface expressed glycoprotein, elevated in a range of tumors, and is associated with cancer survival, growth, metastasis, drug resistance and poor prognosis. This target is highly expressed in various epithelial cancers, including triple negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, advanced malignancies with limited treatment options also demonstrate high target expression, suggesting that AMB304 may provide potential clinical benefits. Furthermore, elevated expression of the target is associated with resistance to anti-tumor drugs, such as EGFR TKIs (e.g., Gefitinib) and trastuzumab, via signaling. In this study, we investigated the cancer-specific therapeutic potential of AMB304, focusing on its preclinical characterization, including anti-cancer efficacy and safety profile.Methods:Various types of tumor cell lines were treated with AMB304 using tumor spheroid model. For in vivo efficacy study, cancer cell lines or patients derived cells were inoculated subcutaneously in mice xenograft models. Target expression intensity in each tumor model was identified through immunohistochemistry (IHC). The toxicity profiles of AMB304 were analyzed, and its pharmacokinetics were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys.Results:AMB304 exhibited robust potency against target-expressing cancer cell lines, as evidenced by cell viability assay and compelling efficacy in various xenograft models, with IHC confirming its tumor regression depends on target expression. It exhibited target-specific binding, efficient internalization, and a strong bystander killing effect. In cynomolgus monkeys, AMB304 was well- tolerated with no significant adverse events at tolerable doses. Its stable linker chemistry minimized payload release, and it showed favorable pharmacokinetics, supporting its clinical potential.Conclusion:This study demonstrates that AMB304 is potent ADC with significant anticancer efficacy and an excellent safety profile. Moreover, its superior stability in plasma enhances its potential for clinical treatment. Therefore, AMB304 could be developed as a targeted therapy for advanced solid tumors with high target expression.Citation Format:Do-Hyun Nam, Yeong-Woo Kim, Byeongkwi Min, Wonsik Jung, Eunsuk Choi, Jungsu Shin, Nam-Gu Her.

    "abstract": "IL-1RAP is the common co-receptor of all IL-1-related cytokines, and constitutes a novel type of ADC target due to its strong expression on both tumor cells and immunosuppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The increased value of this target is complemented by the dependency of certain tumors on IL-1RAP-dependent signaling arguing for a lower chance of antigen loss in response to anti-IL-1RAP therapies. IL-1RAP overall low expression in healthy tissues, also minimizes the risk of on-target off-tumor effects. While healthy tissues exhibit minimal plasma membrane IL-1RAP expression, tumoral tissues demonstrate high IL-1RAP expression, particularly in cancers with squamous histology such as HNSCC and ESCC, as well as other tumor types such as GBM, PDAC, Ewing Sarcoma (EWS) and AML.We developed ADV-101, an ADC consisting of a humanized anti-IL-1RAP IgG1 mAb conjugated to a clinically validated topoisomerase I inhibitor via a cleavable linker (DAR of 8). The anti-IL-1RAP antibody of ADV-101 was shown to be highly specific and selective to IL-1RAP, binding to both human and cynomolgus recombinant protein with EC50 values of 0.095 nM and 0.072 nM, respectively (ELISA), and with an EC50 of 6.47 nM to human IL-1RAP (by SPR). The antibody was also demonstrated to bind IL-1RAP-expressing cells from different cancer indications, with EC50 values ranging from 0.35 to 2.1 nM, and showed specific internalization in a panel of IL-1RAP-expressing cell lines, with EC50 values ranging between 0.34 and 4.44 nM. Notably, this binding and internalization were unaffected by the presence of excess IL-1\u03b2 ligand. There was no impact of payload-linker conjugation on the ADC binding affinity to IL-1RAP protein and expressing cells. The ADC effectively killed IL-1RAP-positive cells in vitro, with IC50 values ranging from 0.02 to 78.5 nM. In vivo, ADV-101 demonstrated strong anti-tumor efficacy in established tumors derived from CDX models (including large tumors) and PDX models. An in vivo efficacy study in six EWS PDX models with varying levels of IL-1RAP expression and derived from both metastatic and primary disease demonstrated high anti-tumor efficacy in 5 out of 6 models, including full tumor regression, even in tumors known to be resistant to topoisomerase I/II inhibitors. ADV-101 safety was further established in a non-human primate (NHP) dose-range finding toxicity study, showing no severe adverse events up to the highest dose tested (50 mg/kg), together with robust pharmacokinetics data confirming exposure. Altogether, these findings warrant further development to bring ADV-101 to the clinic.Citation Format:Edouard De Dreuzy, Soha El Sayed, Lucie Bouquet, Stephane Lameynardie, Delphine Genin, Amandine Barberot, Lucas Bourhis, Lucas Demontrond, Clementine Primus, Christophe Ferrand, Marina Deschamps, Alexis Delabri\u00e9re, Laura Demolis, Erik Rutjens, Jens Hasskarl, Ksenija Pavletic, Richard Charles Alfred Sainson.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Vobra duo, a duocarmycin-based humanized ADC (drug-to-antibody ratio is \u223c2.7) targeting B7-H3, shows robust in vivo activity against a range of adult cancer models, and a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys. Initial results from the single agent phase 1 clinical trial of vobra duo (NCT03729596) showed manageable side effects and promising objective response rates in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. B7-H3 is highly expressed in pediatric solid tumors, and it is emerging as a key target for pediatric oncology. Here we report the antitumor activity of vobra duo against preclinical xenograft models of pediatric solid tumors.Methods:Ewing sarcoma (ES), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and neuroblastoma (NB) xenograft models were tested with n=1 or n=2 designs. Osteosarcoma (OS) models, due to their slower growth kinetics and lower rates of tumor regression, were tested with n=10 mice per arm. The study was extended to include malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), hepatoblastoma (HB), and Wilms tumor (WT) models using n=5 mice per treatment group. vobra duo and control ADC (SYD988 anti-CD20 ADC with the same linker and payload as vobra duo) were provided by MacroGenics, Inc., and were administered at 6 mg/kg as a single administration IP. Time-to-event was defined as 4-fold increase in tumor xenograft volume from the day of treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare event-free survival (EFS) between treated and control groups. Objective response categories were determined as described previously (Ped Blood Cancer 2007;49:928-940), with objective responses including partial, complete, and maintained complete responses (PR, CR, and MCR).Results:Vobra duo induced objective responses in 4 of 11 NB models (3 CR and 1 MCR) and in 3 of 5 OS models (2 MCR). ES models showed objective responses in 2 of 6 models (1 MCR) and 4 of 6 RMS models showed objective responses, all MCR. Control ADC was less active than vobra duo and showed objective responses in 0 of 11 NB, 1 of 5 OS, 1 of 6 ES, and 2 of 4 RMS models. The study was extended to MRT, HB, and WT models. Vobra duo induced objective responses in 2 of 4 MRT with 1 MCR, 2 of 5 HB with 2 MCR, and 3 of 4 WT with 3 MCR. Control ADC only induced objective responses in 1 of 4 MRT and 2 of 4 WT models (all PR), with no objective responses for the 5 HB models.Conclusions:Vobra duo is potently efficacious across a broad panel of pediatric solid tumor xenograft models supporting clinical development of this agent and other agents targeting B7-H3 for children with cancer.Citation Format:Haiying Tang, Edward Favours, Samson Ghilu, Peyton Wong, Vanessa Del Pozo, Abhik Bandyopadhyay, Elena Mironova, Eric J.

    "abstract": "Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of rapidly developing targeted biotherapeutic drugs, which consist of three elements: antibody, linker, and payload. ADCs combine the high specificity of antibodies with the potency of payloads, delivering the highly efficient small molecule within the target tumor cells.As one of the new payload types, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist can initiate the innate immune response, enhancing the attack on tumor cells. STING agonist ADCs, allowing tumor-localized activation of STING, may achieve greater anti-tumor activity and better tolerability.By combining the STING binding assay, different THP-1 reporter assay, we can support for STING agonist activities screening. RT-qPCR assay and WB assay can be applied for demonstrating the molecular mechanisms of candidates. For specific screening and evaluation of HER2 STING agonist ADCs, HER2 overexpression reporter assay, co-culture assays of tumor cell lines or STING knockout tumor cell lines with THP-1, hPBMC, as well as whole blood can be utilized at different project stages.Citation Format:Ying Meng, Li Li, Min Kang, Xiao Li, Haiting Dai, Tj (Tiejun) Bing.

    "abstract": "Background:Urothelial Carcinoma (UC) is the tenth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for more than 200 000 deaths annually (Ferlay, 2020, Sung, 2021). Despite advances over the past decade, particularly with the introduction of immunotherapy (ICI) in various disease settings alongside conventional platinum-based chemotherapy, the prognosis for metastatic UC (mUC) remains poor.Antibody drug-conjugates (ADC) have emerged as a novel treatment option for mUC, offering selective and targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents to cancer cells. ADCs targeting tumor-associated surface proteins including Nectin-4, trophoblastic cell surface antigen 2 (Trop-2) and tyrosine kinase receptor ERBB-2 (HER2), have demonstrated promising efficacy and are all approved for mUC (Wong, 2021, Goodson, 2023). However, the response rate to these ADCs in mUC is limited 25-40% and with a growing portfolio of accessible ADCs, identifying predictive biomarkers to optimize treatment selection remains an unmet medical need.The use of multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) offers deeper insights into tissue microenvironment and can potentially be used to better stratify patients for the various ADC targets in cancer. Recently, an integrated assay combining the sequential IF for protein detection with RNAscope was developed for Lunaphore\u2019s COMET platform. This allows for simultaneous detection of several RNA targets and their corresponding proteins to be analyzed within the same cells. While the ADC target proteins have been shown to be highly expressed in many UC patients, there are limited studies characterizing the spatial expression of these protein targets, especially in combination with their corresponding transcripts.Methods:The integrated assay of the COMET platform offers a fully automated workflow that includes iterative cycles of staining, imaging and elution facilitating the simultaneous detection of RNA and proteins at single cell resolution. We used custom designed RNAscope probes (ACDBio), a SPYRE antibody panel (Lunaphore) and additional antibodies to detect the ADC-targets Nectin-4, Trop-2 and HER-2, and to spatially map the tumor microenvironment of human FFPE bladder cancer tissues from a cohort of mUC patients.Results& Discussion: We have optimized the assay for bladder cancer tissues on the COMET platform to detect multiple ADC targets at transcript and protein levels. We aim to employ the integrated multi-omics setup to explore the expression of the ADC targets in sections from a retrospective cohort of mUC patients treated by monotherapy with Enfortumab Vedotin (EV) in the third line. We have already observed differences across patients with regard to Nectin-4, Trop-2 and HER-2 protein expression and aim to better characterize the spatial distribution and expression of these tumor-associated antigens with the inclusion of target transcripts and the association to treatment benefit from EV.Citation Format:Pranauti Panshikar, Eleanor O\u00b4Roberts, David Krantz, Tony Ullman, Carolina Oses Sepulveda, Fernanda Svedman, P\u00e4ivi \u00d6stling, Anders Ull\u00e9n, Charlotte Stadler.

    "abstract": "Background:Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is overexpressed in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). SSTR2-targeted treatment options for NETs include somatostatin analogs and radionuclide conjugates (RDCs). In SCLC, SSTR2-targeted therapies, including RAZ101 (225Ac bearing RDC), PEN221 (peptide drug conjugate) etc., have shown encouraging clinical results. Unfortunately, such therapies with peptide (SSA analogs like octreotide) suffer from short half-lives and high toxicities due to poor selectivity. Moreover, RDCs are often restricted by limited availability. To tackle these, a highly selective and potent antibody against SSTR2 could offer a promising therapeutic alternative. Here, we present CS5005, a novel SSTR2-targeted ADC developed to treat SSTR2-positive tumors, including NETs and SCLC.Methods:SSTR2-targeted antibodies were generated from immunized mice, followed with rounds of screening, maturation and humanization. The lead antibody of CS5005 was selected based on the binding, internalization capacity, and selectivity for SSTR2. CS5005 is composed of our lead SSTR2-targeted humanized antibody, a proprietary CSL linker and a well-validated topoisomerase 1 inhibitor exatecan (EXd). The plasma-stable, hydrophilic, beta-glucuronide CSL linker enables effectively tumor-selective toxin release. The antitumor activity of CS5005 was evaluated in vitro and in vivo using cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models originated from multiple carcinomas. Tolerability and PK were assessed in rodents and cynomolgus monkeys.Results:The lead humanized SSTR2-targeted antibody, 221.3.1, demonstrated high-affinity binding to SSTR2-positive cells (e.g. SSTR2-overexpressing HEK, H524, and H446) and high-rate internalization on tumor cells. Importantly, 221.3.1 selectively bound SSTR2 without cross-reactivity to other somatostatin receptors. 221.3.1\u2019s cross-species recognition of SSTR2 supported the selection of cynomolgus monkey for nonclinical toxicology studies. CS5005 retained the antibody features of binding affinity, internalization and selectivity, showing excellent in vitro stability in serum incubation assays and a mAb-like PK profile in the in vivo rodent studies. In vitro cytotoxicity assays confirmed the ability of CS5005 to induce effective, target-dependent killing of SSTR2-expressing tumor cells. CS5005 also demonstrated robust in vivo antitumor activity in CDX models originated from multiple carcinomas, with minimal effective dose (MED) of 5 mg/kg. Pilot toxicity studies in non-human primates demonstrated a favorable tolerability and PK profile of CS5005.Conclusion:CS5005 represents a promising SSTR2-targeted ADC for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. The preclinical findings support further IND-enabling studies and clinical investigations of CS5005 as a novel therapeutical option.Citation Format:Chuan Wang, Xinling Zhang, Ning Zhang, Yamin Wang, Yongwang Li, Xuelian Liu, Mengyao Zhu, Yuxin Qian, Yongli Yang, Jingyu Sun, Xueqin Dai, Fei Ma, Yi Sun, Jianxin Yang.

    "abstract": "Introduction:Mucin-17 (MUC17) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, expressed on the apical membrane of normal gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial cells, play important roles in preventing infection at mucosal surfaces1-2. MUC17 is a promising target for ADC development due to its highly expressed in gastric, colon and pancreatic cancers, but limit normal organs expression.Methods:HDM2012 is a MUC17 targeting ADC, consisting of a topoisomerase inhibitor via a cleavable liker with average drug antibody ratio (DAR) 8. The efficacy and safety of HDM2012 was tested in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models and monkeys, respectively.Results:HDM2012 showed target dependent anti-tumor activity and by-stander effect in vitro. HDM2012 exhibits good efficacy in PDX and CDX models. In gastric PDX models, HDM2012 demonstrated dose dependent efficacy, with TGI (tumor growth inhibition) value of 82-93%, regardless of prior Ironitecan and Top-I ADC treatment. In heavily pre-treated colon cancer PDX models, HDM2012 induced prolonged tumor regression, with TGI value of 94.6%. Furthermore, in MUC17 low expression pancreatic PDX models, HDM2012 could induce sustained tumor regression, with TGI value of 91.5%. In exploratory toxicology study, HDM2012 is well tolerated by cynomolgus monkeys at 45 mpk.Conclusion:Here, we reporting a novel ADC product HDM2012 targeting MUC17, is a potential therapeutic approach for MUC17 positive GC, CRC, PDAC cancer treatment. All the experiment data indicated HDM2012 may be a promising candidate for GI cancer treatment.Reference:1. Gum JR, et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun.2002;291:466-475. 2. Van Putten JPM, et al.

    "abstract": "Background:Transmembrane-4-L-six-family member-1 (TM4SF1) is a tetraspanin superfamily member that is overexpressed in cancers such as breast, colon, lung, liver, and prostate. A contributor to tumor development and progression, TM4SF1 participates in microdomains that regulate cancer cell migration and invasion via induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. The overexpression of TM4SF1 makes it an attractive target for the developing novel treatments of GI tract cancers.Methods and Results:We have engineered an anti-TM4SF1 antibody that binds with nM affinity to TM4SF1-expressing cells. The mAb has anti-tumor growth inhibition in gastric, ovarian cancer cell lines. This mAb can serve as an efficacious targeting carrier for toxins in an ADC and for siRNA in an ARC. To broaden the scope of cancer cell engagement, we prepared constructed a TM4SF1-cMET bispecific ADC which showed potent cytotoxicity in multiple GI, lung, ovarian, breast, TNBC, and pancreatic cancer cell lines in in vitro cell cytotoxicity assays. The bispecific TM4SF1-cMET MMAE (DAR=4) treatment led to potent tumor growth inhibition (70% to 95% TGI) in CDX pancreatic and gastric cancer xenograft models. The mice in the TM4SF1-cMET MMAE treatment group maintained normal body weight throughout the treatment course without observed toxicity. The TM4SF1 - MYC siRNA conjugates were stable. Treatment of MYC-dependent cancer lines led to MYC protein knockdown and cell growth inhibition.Conclusions:A bispecific TM4SF1 ADC had activity in multiple cancer cell lines. Notably, the TM4SF1-MMAE molecule showed potent in vivo tumor growth inhibition in ovarian, pancreatic, and gastric cell lines. The TM4SF1 - siRNA ARC had tumor cell proliferation inhibition in lung, pancreatic, and gastric cancer cell lines. Preclinical safety assessment, pharmacokinetics and IND-enabling studies are on-going with the goal of developing TM4SF1 as the \u201cbest-in-class\u201d ADC molecule for the treatment of lung, gastric, breast, and pancreatic cancers with significant unmet medical needs. This antibody can be applied to alternative targeting modalities.Citation Format:Mingquan Xie, Peter Li, Han Lu, ShuTing Dong, Nicole Wilski, Poonam Pandey, Nishida Motohiko, Peter Haytko, Mark Chiu, Maria P.

    "abstract": "Our recent studies identified the cell surface protein IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) as a crucial regulator of redox homeostasis and a suppressor of ferroptosis (iron-mediated cell death) in Ewing sarcoma (EwS). IL1RAP directly binds to the CD98/xCT plasma membrane antiporter to enhance cystine uptake, thereby replenishing cysteine and glutathione (GSH) pools in EwS cells. Moreover, when extracellular cystine is limited, IL1RAP induces cystathionine gamma lyase (CTH) to activate the transsulfuration (TSS) pathway for de novo cysteine synthesis. IL1RAP depletion diminishes GSH pools and induces oxidative stress to trigger anoikis and ferroptosis, thereby inhibiting EwS metastatic capacity. Importantly, IL1RAP is minimally expressed in normal tissues, including blood and bone marrow, with placenta as the only normal tissue to express IL1RAP, nominating this protein as a promising immunotherapy target. Here, we uncover that distinct fusion oncoproteins activate IL1RAP expression in cancers of different lineages, including EWS-ETS fusions in Ewing sarcoma (EwS), the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in diverse tumor types, and the NPM-ALK fusion in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). To target IL1RAP in these cancers via immunotherapy, we identified a highly specific IL1RAP binder from phage-display biopanning, and engineered an IL1RAP-directed human IgG based antibody-drug conjugate (ADC; X12-IL1RAP-PBD) linked to the DNA damaging agent, pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD). In proof-of-concept studies, our proprietary X12-IL1RAP-PBD induced potent DNA damage, apoptosis, and bystander cell killing in in vitro. In preclinical mouse models, X12-IL1RAP-PBD induces dramatic and durable regression of tumor xenografts expressing of the oncofusions at dosing of only 0.2mg/kg. Moreover, essentially no signs of toxicity were noted, with stable body weights and no histological evidence of toxicity in vital organs such as liver, lung, kidney, and brain. Moreover, X12-IL1RAP-PBD fully blocked tail vein injected EwS cell-induced liver changes in vivo, again without any toxicity. Thus, this first-in-class IL1RAP-targeting ADC is highly efficacious in preclinical models of multiple oncofusion-driven cancers, warranting further clinical translation.Citation Format:Haifeng Zhang, Wei Li, Xiaqiu Yang, Qingfeng Huang, Yue Zhou Huang, Alberto Delaidelli, Andrew Lytle, Melanie Rouleau, Christian Steidl, Dimiter Dimitrov, Poul Sorensen.

    "abstract": "Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein with abundant glycosylation. In normal tissues, MUC1 is present at the apical surface of epithelial cells, while epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is present at the basal surface of epithelial cells. Tumor cells lose apical-basal polarity, leading to even distribution of EGFR and MUC1 on cell surface, a phenomenon that allows EGFR and MUC1 to be spatially close together. And EGFR and MUC1 are highly co-expressed in a variety of tumors, e.g., non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and breast cancer (BC), among others. Accordingly, bispecific ADCs targeting EGFR and MUC1 preferentially target dual-expressed tumor cells, reducing the binding to normal tissues, meanwhile conjugating with TOPi, which can improve the efficacy. And the EGFR-MUC1 bispecific ADCs have a wider range of indications and patient populations. E-M-TOPi, a EGFR and MUC1 bispecific ADC, consists of a EGFR-MUC1 bispecific antibody (E-M), a cleavable linker and a topoisomerase I inhibitor. TOPi exhibited potent cytotoxicity with good membrane permeability. The binding affinities of E-M to EGFR and MUC1 were optimized to enhance tumor cell selectivity, increase endocytosis, and improve pharmacokinetics (PK). Considering the wide expression of EGFR in normal tissue, the binding affinity of E-M to EGFR was reduced to be weaker than that to MUC1, thereby enhancing the selectivity for EGFR-MUC1 co-expressing tumors while minimizing the toxicity to normal tissues. E-M-TOPi demonstrated significantly stronger EGFR/MUC1 dependent growth inhibition in various tumor cell lines. In HCC827 and HPAC (different EGFR-MUC1 co-expression levels) xenograft mouse models, E-M-TOPi inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Tumor regression was observed at 6 mg/kg of E-M-TOPi and sustained till day 30 in HCC827 model and day 28 in HPAC model. In addition, E-M-TOPi showed good human plasma stability and favorable cyno PK profile. Less than 0.5% of payload was released into human plasma after a 21-day incubation. Half-life of E-M-TOPi was more than 4 days in cyno monkey. In summary, by fine-tuning the EGFR-MUC1 bispecific antibody affinity and incorporating a superior bystander effect, E-M-TOPi holds the potential to be a best-in-class therapeutic candidate.Citation Format:Ziheng Liu, Le Sun, Bing Hu, Lingfeng You, Xinyu Gao, Jin Shao, Shimeng Liu, Beibei Fu, Ying Li, Manting Zhang, Dandan Xiong, Yan Liu, Guangbao Qiu, Ziwei Ren, Zhendong Xue, Yuchang Mao, Huaixin Dang, Ting Zhang, Xin Ye, Shuyu Cai, Jun Feng, Min Hu, Feng He.

    "abstract": "Background:PCa is the most common cancer among men worldwide. Once patients have progressed to castration resistance, treatment options become scarce, leaving a substantial unmet need in the mCRPC settings. Both B7-H3 and PSMA are tumor-associated antigens that exhibit high levels of expression in PCa, and dual targeting of them with a single agent represents a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of mCRPC. We developed GenSci143, a novel B7-H3\u00d7PSMA-directed bispecific ADC comprised of a bispecific antibody against B7-H3 and PSMA, a highly stable but cleavable linker, and a potent topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload. Potential of GenSci143 as a novel targeted cancer therapy is currently evaluated in preclinical studies.Methods:Membrane expression of B7-H3 and PSMA in tissue microarrays of PCa biopsies was examined by immunohistochemistry analysis. Cell surface levels of B7-H3 and PSMA in PCa cell lines were quantified by flow cytometry using Quantibrite beads. Binding affinity of GenSci143 to B7-H3- and/or PSMA-expressing tumor cells was also determined using flow cytometry. To assess internalization, cells were treated with pHrodoTM-labelled antibodies, and fluorescence intensity was recorded. In vitro cytotoxic effect of GenSci143 on PCa cell lines was evaluated using a Luminescent Cell Viability assay. In vivo anti-tumor activity of GenSci143 was assessed in CDX models of PCa and compared to that of the DS-7300 and ARX517 analogs.Results:B7-H3 and PSMA were highly co-expressed in PCa tissues (N=102), lending strong support to our dual-targeting therapeutic approach for mCRPC. GenSci143 showed strong in vitro binding, internalization, and cytotoxicity in tumor cells expressing either B7-H3 or PSMA or both TAAs. In human CDX models of PCa in mice, GenSci143 effectively induced tumor regression across different expression levels of B7-H3 and PSMA and demonstrated superior anti-tumor efficacy versus the DS-7300 and ARX517 analogs. Moreover, GenSci143 showed much better in vitro plasma stability than DS-7300. Following intravenous injection at 10 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys, GenSci143 exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, with serum concentration of free payload lower than 1.0 ng/mL at any time examined. In a pilot non-GLP repeat dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, GenSci143 was well tolerated, demonstrating a significantly higher therapeutic index than DS-7300 based on PK-PD modeling and simulation.Conclusion:These results suggest that GenSci143 has the potential to become an effective therapeutic option for mCRPC patients and support its further evaluation in IND-enabling studies.Citation Format:Yao Xu, Fu Li, Zhiyu Cui, Hongmei Xie, Wei Yan, Yan Li, Weiming He, Wenqiang Zhai, Fanglong Yang, John L.

    "abstract": "PDL1V is a novel vedotin antibody drug-conjugate (ADC) currently in Phase I clinical development for advanced solid tumors as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab (NCT05208762). The primary mechanism of action (MOA) of PDL1V is direct cytotoxicity to PD-L1-expressing tumor cells via the intracellular delivery of MMAE. While PD-L1 is an established checkpoint protein, pharmacokinetic data suggest steric checkpoint inhibition by PDL1V may be limited by the dose and schedule being evaluated in the clinic. Here, we characterized additional antitumor MOAs of PDL1V, including bystander killing and immunogenic cell death (ICD), and evaluated the effects of PDL1V on immune cells.PDL1V is potently cytotoxic to a variety of PD-L1-positive cancer cell lines in vitro. Using a flow cytometry-based viability assay, we showed that PDL1V also drives dose-dependent bystander effect-based cytotoxicity of PD-L1-negative tumor cells when co-cultured with PD-L1-positive tumor cells. ICD, a regulated activation of immune cell recruitment to the TME, is caused by tumor cell release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as cell surface chaperone calreticulin (CRT), extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP), and High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1). PD-L1-positive cancer cells treated with PDL1V in vitro released all three DAMPs, suggesting that targeted delivery of the MMAE payload drives induction of ICD.As an immune checkpoint protein, PD-L1 is expressed on antigen presenting cells and T cells. Depletion of these cells could affect the tolerability of PDL1V as a monotherapy, or limit efficacy in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies. To investigate the potential for immune cell depletion, macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells were evaluated in an in vitro fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay. PDL1V had minimal cytotoxic activity across all three cell-types, despite expression of PD-L1. These data support PDL1V as selectively cytotoxic to PD-L1-positive and negative cancer cells of the tumor microenvironment, and not cytotoxic to PD-L1-positive immune cells involved in natural antitumor immunity. Since T cell-driven antitumor immunity is a key driver for the efficacy of PD-(L)1 blockade, these data suggest PDL1V is a promising combination partner with anti-PD-1 immunotherapies such as pembrolizumab. Future studies will evaluate the effects of PDL1V on immunosuppressive cells, including regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells, and the pharmacodynamic effects of PDL1V in syngeneic mouse xenograft models.Ethics Approval: All procedures performed on animals were in accordance with regulations and established guidelines and were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or through an ethical review process.Citation Format:Megan Atkins Ramirez, Midori Clarke, Steven Jin, Ellie Moskovitz, Andres Forero-Torres, Garrett Cornelison.

    "abstract": "Introduction:FGFR2b is a novel protein biomarker detected by IHC with the overexpression rate of \u223c30% (any 2+/3+) in gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer(GC/GEJC) patients, and among those patients \u223c40% are not eligible for currently approved targeted therapies (HER2, PD-L1, MMR and CLDN18.2)1. HDM2020 is a topoisomerase Inhibitor based DAR8 ADC developed using a novel Ab targeted against FGFR2b, which has the potential to treat FGFR2b overexpressing tumor with reasonable safety window2.Methods: In vivo cell line (CDX) and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models were conducted to validate the therapeutic potential of HDM2020 against GC and sq-NSCLC. FGFR2b expression were detected by IHC using various tumor paraffin sections.Results: Combination of HDM2020 and avastin or paclitaxel demonstrated a synergistic effect in GC CDX model. Single-agent therapeutic activity of HDM2020 was demonstrated in two FGFR2b-positive GC PDX models with TP53 or BCOR gene mutation and at least 1st line chemotherapy. At a dose of 10mg/kg, the maximum tumor growth inhibition rate were 98% and 99%. In FGFR2b middle expressed sq-NSCLC PDX model, complete response was observed at single dose of 10mg/kg. The minimum effective doses were between 2.5-3mg/kg in above three models. FGFR2b is overexpressed in GC, sq-NSCLC, TNBC and may other tumor types. Conclusion: Based on the clinical validation of FGFR2b in GC and signs of early preclinical activity in sq-NSCLC with significant unmet need, HDM2020 might has promising efficacy in these indications. HDM2020 is expected to enter clinical development in 2025.References:1: Seiya Sato, Shannon L Rhodes, et al.

    "abstract": "Background:Mesothelin (MSLN) is a cell surface protein in various cancers, including ovarian, pancreatic and malignant mesothelioma. Soluble mesothelin (sMSLN) can be detected in the circulation of patients and may reduce the efficacy of antibody drugs targeting surface MSLN. Acting as a decoy receptor, sMSLN competes for binding or neutralizes the drug, affecting antibody properties. This study examined the anti MSLN antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) RC88, focusing on its ability to target cancer cells and the interference caused by sMSLN, thereby highlighting its competitive advantage over other drugs in clinical studies.Methods:RC88, a novel anti MSLN ADC developed by RemeGen, is in phase I/II trials for advanced solid tumors, either as monotherapy (NCT04175847, NCT06173037) or in combination therapy (NCT05804526). We compared RC88 with other anti MSLN antibodies from relevant trials by antigen and cell binding assays. To show the unique binding of RC88, we treated cellular MSLNs in various conditions to mimic in vivo pathological environments. Additionally, we expressed a truncated MSLN fragment in 293 cells to focus on the C-terminal region near the cell membrane for binding comparisons.Results:Our analysis revealed the distinctive properties of RC88 that may provide clinical advantages. RC88 had a strong primary binding site in the N-terminal domain and a weaker secondary site in the C-terminal region. The primary binding site at amino acids 317-352 was characterized by cross-linking mass spectrometry and mutagenesis. This epitope also facilitates CA125 binding, and RC88 effectively blocks CA125 from binding to MSLN. The secondary binding site located in the C-terminal stem region (amino acids 577-606) was less prominent and appeared to enhance tumor cell binding of RC88. Although further studies are required to refine the location of this secondary site, RC88 demonstrated its ability to bind and induce ADC-mediated cell death in cells expressing the C-terminal fragment of MSLN, a response not seen with other anti MSLN antibodies. When comparing cell binding in the presence of sMSLN, RC88 showed stronger cancer cell binding than others.Conclusions:Our findings show RC88 has unique binding kinetics to different MSLN regions, with a dominant N-terminal binding site by rigorous methods. RC88 displayed superior binding to MSLN-positive cancer cells than other anti MSLN antibodies and maintained effectiveness despite sMSLN interference. Its stronger binding to the C-terminal MSLN fragment compared with other antibodies further underscores its targeting potential in tumor cells. Given its distinctive binding properties, RC88 may bring enhanced clinical benefits for treating MSLN-positive cancers, even with sMSLN and various truncated forms of MSLN in tumor cells. Therefore, RC88 is likely to have greater clinical benefits than other MSLN ADCs in clinical studies.Citation Format:Lili Wang, Yidan Xu, Mingyang Li, Kailin Wang, Xiao Wang, Xiaoping Zhang, Zhanjiao Yu, Yinghao Xin, Chenglin He, Xiangyi He, Xiaoshan Min, Hang Chen, Min Li, Zhulun Wang, Dong Li, Yuanhao Li.

    "abstract": "Background:To date, 15 ADCs have been globally approved, 9 of which employ Michael addition reactions between maleimide and the free thiol groups of antibodies. This reaction is characterized by high selectivity, mild conditions, and rapid kinetics. However, the retro-Michael addition reaction in vivo can reverse this process, leading to payload detachment, which compromises the drug\u2019s efficacy and safety. The SuperHydraTM linker promotes maleimide ring-opening via ortho effects, preventing retro-Michael deconjugation and enhancing ADC stability. Consequently, ADCs with the SuperHydraTM linker demonstrate remarkable efficacy, safety, and better stability as represented by our clinical stage candidate, SMP-656, a HER2-eribulin ADC.Methods:SuperHydra\u2122 linkers were designed with varying ortho groups, distances, and pro-hydrolysis group optimizations. A medium hydrolysis-rate linker was chosen for SMP-656 to balance stability during CMC stages with controlled hydrolysis in circulation, ensuring ADC homogeneity. Comparative studies of SMP-656 vs. DS-8201a were performed in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we evaluated SMP-656's cytotoxicity against DS-8201a-induced resistant cells and cells overexpressing the DXd efflux pump. Bystander effects, critical for DS-8201a efficacy, were assessed for SMP-656. Repeat-dose PK and toxicology studies in non-human primates provided PK data and HNSTD.Results:SMP-656 demonstrated significantly higher efficacy than DS-8201a in various cancer cell lines, including DS-8201a-resistant gastric cancer and HER2-low breast cancer cells. It retained potency in resistant models where DS-8201a was ineffective, highlighting its potential for treating resistant and HER2-low patients.In vivo studies showed that SMP-656 achieved higher tumor growth inhibition rates than DS-8201a, with only half the DAR and one-third the dosing amount. This translates to superior tumor inhibition with one-sixth the toxin dosage, highlighting its enhanced safety profile. In NCI-N87 xenografts model, SMP-656 extended tumor inhibition to 62 days at an equivalent payload dose 0.08 mpk (single dose), compared to DS-8201a's 23 days. SMP-656 also demonstrated significant bystander effects, addressing tumor heterogeneity.Repeat-dose PK studies showed high concordance between ADC and total antibody concentration curves, confirming SuperHydraTM linker stability. Additionally, SMP-656 achieved an HNSTD of 10 mpk, representing the highest safety profile among eribulin-based ADCs known to date.Conclusions:The SuperHydraTM linker enabled SMP-656 to combine superior stability, efficacy, and safety with the ability to overcome DS-8201a resistance. SMP-656 represents the safest and most effective eribulin-based ADC and is currently in Phase I clinical trials, showing promising tolerability and efficacy.Citation Format:Jinkun Huang, Chenglong Wu, Chaoyang Feng, Xiaojie Heng, Tingting Yang, Rang Gao, Tianyi Ke.

    "abstract": "Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the folate receptor family, is highly expressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and increases following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). PSMA is a validated diagnostic and therapeutic target for radioligands and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). TD001 is a novel ADC composed of a deimmunized anti-PSMA IgG1 monoclonal antibody (HuJ591) conjugated to a highly stable protease-cleavable proprietary linker and the potent Topo I inhibitor exatecan payload. The LD038 linker-payload leverages exatecan\u2019s ability to stabilize Topo I-DNA complexes and induce DNA damage and cell death. We tested TD001 in 2D and 3D cell cultures and in vivo in human CRPC xenograft models with different levels of PSMA expression. We evaluated cell internalization, payload release, and drug activity by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Free payload levels were measured 24 h post treatment in plasma and tumors by LC-MS/MS. TD001 showed efficient binding and rapid internalization within 1-3 h followed by lysosomal localization and payload release in PSMA-expressing cells. Due to the quick and effective payload release, TD001 exhibited selective and potent activity with the induction of Topo I-mediated DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3). TD001 had no effect on PSMA-negative cells. This was supported by 3D cell culture models, which demonstrated rapid diffusion into the extracellular matrix, and rapid internalization of TD001 into PSMA-expressing tumor cells. TD001 was evaluated in vivo in three CRPC xenograft models with different PSMA expression patterns: the high/homogenous (\u223c104 ligands/cell) PSMA-expressing LNCaP-abl cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) castrated mouse model, the intermediate/heterogeneous (\u223c102-104 ligands/cell) PSMA-expressing 22Rv1 CDX castrated mouse model, and the AR-positive, high/homogenous (\u223c105 ligands/cell)-PSMA-expressing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) C5 mouse model. The LD038 linker-payload in TD001 resulted in high free payload release within tumor tissue, triggering DNA damage, cell death, and growth arrest. Notably, tumor uptake and a very high tumor/plasma ratio (70-100 fold) of exatecan were similar 24 h after IV administration in all three in vivo models despite substantial differences in PSMA expression and heterogeneity. These findings highlight the ability of TD001 to deliver effectively and selectively the payload exatecan to PSMA-positive prostate tumors, resulting in potent antitumor activity in different CRPC models, including those with intermediate and heterogenous PSMA expression.Citation Format:Daniela Impellizzieri, Elisa Storelli, Atik Balla, Simone Mosole, Cristina Dongilli, Federico Jauk, Roberta Frapolli, Lavinia Morosi, Maurizio D'Incalci, Jemila Houacine, Morris Rosenberg, B\u00e9rang\u00e8re Deleglise, Esteban Cvitkovic, Carlo V.

    "abstract": "c-MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the MET proto-oncogene, is widely expressed in various solid tumors. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) targeting c-Met have shown promising clinical activity in patients with high c-MET expression, yet the therapeutic benefit remains limited for those with moderate or low expression levels. Here, we present the development and preclinical characterization of MHB042C, a next-generation anti-c-Met ADC.Unlike conventional monoclonal antibody (mAb), MHB042C utilizes a humanized VHH targeting c-Met, fused with human IgG1 Fc to deliver the cytotoxic payload. The smaller VHH-Fc fusion protein offers higher potential for tumor tissue penetration compared to traditional mAb. This unique configuration streamlines the conjugation process, achieving a uniform drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4. Additionally, Fc function was silenced to minimize nonspecific ADC uptake. The payload, SuperTopoiTM, a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, was 3 to 5 times more potent than DXd. The linker was designed to enhance hydrophilicity and to resist the retro-Michael reaction, thereby improving plasma stability. In preclinical assays, MHB042C demonstrated stronger cellular binding than competitor antibodies, reaching an internalization rate of approximately 60% in Hs746t cells within one hour. MHB042C exhibited potent cytotoxicity across c-Met-positive cancer cell lines and showed marked antitumor activity in an EBC-1 Squamous NSCLC xenograft model. GLP study in monkeys revealed a favorable safety profile with no off-target toxicities. The highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was determined to be 15 mg/kg Q3W, the maximum dose tested.In conclusion, MHB042C demonstrated potent antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, along with a favorable safety profile, supporting advancement to clinical development.Citation Format:Bo Liu, Liyuan Zhu, Yile Chen, Xiang Meng, Ao Li, Li Liu, Zhili Yao, Yan Wang, Xialian Weng, Xuefeng Zhu, Yang Liu, Shiyu Zhou, Junwei Shi, Guoqing Cao.

It is overexpressed in various malignancies, including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, as well as cholangiocarcinoma, where it has been associated with tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) targeting B7-H4 have demonstrated promising clinical activity. Here, we present the development and preclinical characterization of MHB009C, a novel B7-H4 ADC.MHB009C comprises a human IgG1 antibody against B7-H4, conjugated to the SuperTopoiTM payload, a novel DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor that is 3\u223c5 times more potent than DXd, with a drug-antibody ratio of \u223c4.0.

    "abstract": "PF-08046032 is a novel vedotin antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) engineered to target and deplete immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) through direct cytotoxicity. PF-08046032 directs delivery of the cytotoxic MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E) vedotin payload to cells expressing CD25, the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor, which is highly expressed on intratumoral Tregs and lymphoma cells. The MMAE-based vedotin drug linker platform, utilized in four approved ADCs for hematologic and solid tumors, has a well-characterized mechanism of action (MoA), exposure, and target-independent toxicity profile. PF-08046032 leverages this platform, exerting anti-tumor activity through the multifaceted MMAE-driven MoA, including direct cytotoxicity, bystander killing, and immunogenic cell death. Additionally, PF-08046032 is differentiated from other vedotin ADCs and anti-CD25 depleting agents through affinity-tuned binding, which enables selective targeting of CD25hi intratumoral Tregs while sparing peripheral Tregs. Here, we present preclinical data demonstrating safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of PF-08046032 which is highly consistent with the vedotin ADC platform, while additionally harnessing a Treg-directed anti-tumor approach. PF-08046032 selectively kills Tregs compared to CD8 T cells, with preferential activity on Tregs with the highest CD25 expression and shows dose-dependent antitumor activity in CD25-expressing lymphoma xenograft models. In human CD25-expressing mice bearing MC38 colorectal carcinoma tumors, PF-08046032 significantly suppressed intratumoral Treg levels with minimal activity on peripheral Tregs and no effect on intratumoral CD8+ T cells. A mouse surrogate of PF-08046032 demonstrated that targeted depletion of immunosuppressive tumoral Tregs resulted in robust antitumor activity as both a single agent and in combination with anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor blockade. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies in non-human primates demonstrated safety and PK profiles consistent with the vedotin platform despite targeting CD25. Leveraging the cumulative knowledge of the vedotin platform, PF-08046032 enables a novel additional mechanism of action for vedotin ADCs at potentially efficacious and safe doses. These data support further investigation of PF-08046032 in clinical trials for advanced malignancies.Citation Format:Christopher Carosino, Sherif Abdelhamed, Priyanka Gupta, Xinqun Zhang, Bryan Grogan, Weiping Zeng, Lauren Bou, Devra Olson, Paromita Raha, Andrea R.

    "abstract": "Cadherin-17 (CDH17) is a membranous cell adhesion protein predominantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. High CDH17 expression is associated with metastatic progression in different cancers that mainly originate from gastrointestinal tracts. YL217 is a novel CDH17 -targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and built on MediLink\u2019s TMALIN\u00ae platform, which can release the payload both in the tumor cell and in the tumor microenvironment. This study evaluated efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of YL217 in non-clinical studies. YL217 could specifically bind to CDH17 on tumor cell surfaces, followed with payload release both in the lysosome through internalization and in the tumor microenvironment. These translate in vivo where YL217 showed superior efficacy in causing tumor regressions and good tolerability in both cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (CDX and PDX) mouse models with low to high CDH17 expression levels. The in vivo pharmacokinetics in monkeys showed that YL217 is highly stable with less than 0.1% (molar ratio) payload released in circulation. These non-clinical data suggest the high stability of the linker in circulation as well as efficient payload release in tumors. Moreover, acceptable safety profiles were also noted in monkey GLP toxicity studies. Taken together, preclinical data suggest that YL217 could be further developed in the treatment of CDH17-positive cancer patients.Citation Format:Wei Lian, Qing Zong, Chun Deng, Peng Zou, Liang Xiao, Tongtong Xue, Jiaqiang Cai.

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b, FGFR2IIIb), an alternative splicing isoform of FGFR2, is a receptor tyrosine kinases that activates multiple signaling cascades upon binding of FGFs, promoting cancer cell proliferation. It is also a tumor associated antigen overexpressed in multiple solid tumor types, especially gastric cancer (GC). Indeed, the clinical benefit of targeting FGFR2b has been demonstrated by Bemarituzumab, an Fc-enhanced monoclonal antibody in combination with chemotherapy in first-line FGFR2b-expressing gastric cancer. Here, we report the preclinical characterization of BG-C137, a first-in-class FGFR2b antibody conjugated with a topoisomerase inhibitor. In contrast to Bemarituzumab, which functions through antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis/cytotoxicity and sustained signaling blocking function, BG-C137 introduces direct toxin killing to enhance the tumor inhibition with strong bystander effect to overcome the heterogeneity of FGFR2b expression. Upon antigen engagement, BG-C137 was rapidly internalized and potently killed tumor cells with diverse FGFR2b expression level. Single dose of BG-C137 showed strong anti-tumor efficacy in vivo, including FGFR2b-amplified and non-amplified models. It also demonstrated strong bystander killing effect in vitro and maintained strong anti-tumor efficacy in models with heterogeneous FGFR2b expression. Additionally, we showed that corneal dystrophy, which might correlate with corneal toxicity of Bemarituzumab in the clinic, was caused by its complete signaling blocking function. Whereas BG-C137, with weaker blocking function, spared corneal dystrophy in mice as well as in non-human primates, even at high doses. With its differentiated targeting strategy, BG-C137 is not only a first-in-class FGFR2b ADC but also holds the potential to pursue the best-in-class opportunity in FGFR2b targeting treatments. Together, these observations support the clinical development of BG-C137 for the treatment of FGFR2b-expressing tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06625593).Citation Format:Yibin Xu, Xiaolin Su, Qiming Xu, Mengran Qian, Taichang Zhang, Mei-Hsuan Tsai, Ruyue Ji, Junna Jiang, Bin Shao, Yuan Zhuang, Jiyuan Zhang, Xiaomin Song, Zhitao Wan, Xiaoyan Tang, Yue Wu, Charng-Sheng Tsai, Chichi Huang, Lai Wang, Zhirong Shen.

    "abstract": "There is a critical need to safely enhance the potency of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for targeting low-expression and heterogeneous tumors, as well as to overcome drug resistance and relapse. Cancer cells often develop resistance to single-agent therapies, making it essential to explore combination approaches. One promising strategy presented in this work is combining two payloads with different mechanisms of action (MOA) into a single ADC, creating dual-payload ADCs. Clinical data have shown that if resistance develops to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (Topo1i) ADC, it will also result in resistance to a Topo1i ADC administered sequentially, regardless of the target antigen. This implies that anti-tumor activity of Topo1 ADCs is limited by formation of resistance towards the payload (cross-payload resistance). In contrast, switching to a payload with different MOAs, such as transitioning from Topo1i to microtubule inhibitor or vice versa, can help to restore the effectiveness of ADCs. The combination study of sacituzumab govitecan and enfortumab vedotin has clinically validated the concept of concomitant administration of a Topo1i payload with a microtubule inhibitor (MTi) payload to increase response rates without significantly increasing toxicity. Dual-payload ADCs that combine Topo1i and MTi agents are specifically designed to maximize their anti-tumor activity by overcoming resistance and broadening the therapeutic potential. Another promising dual-payload strategy involves combining PARP inhibitors (PARPi) with Topo1i, as PARP plays a critical role in repairing DNA damage induced by Topo1i. Such a Topo1i/PARPi dual-payload ADC has the potential to improve anti-tumor activity while avoiding toxicities commonly associated with conventional PARPi chemotherapy, due to the lack of targeted delivery. By leveraging Sutro\u2019s cell-free expression platform and its precise dual conjugation technology, we fine-tuned the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and dual payload ratios to achieve optimal synergy between the two MOAs. The homogeneous, dual-payload ADCs demonstrate desirable physicochemical properties, enabled by the careful selection of conjugation sites and a best-in-class hydrophilic \u03b2-glucuronide linker. These design features also resulted in favorable pharmacokinetics and stability of dual-payload ADCs. Using this approach, we identified superior anti-tumor activities against low-antigen and Topo1 ADC-resistant tumor models treated with dual-payload ADCs compared to mono-payload ADCs. Furthermore, the dual payload approach streamlines preclinical, clinical development and the manufacturing process compared to the parallel development of two mono-payload ADCs.Citation Format:Gang Yin, Daniel Calarese, Alice Yam, Werner Rubas, Krishna Bajjuri, Xiaofan Li, Helena Kiefei, Miao Wen, Guifen Xu, Abigail Yu, Hans-Peter Gerber.

    "abstract": "EGFR is a clinically-validated target that is overexpressed and activated in many human cancers and associated with poor prognosis. However, ADCs targeting EGFR exhibit toxicity due to expression on healthy tissue (1), and EGFR can show heterogeneous tumor expression (2). To engineer a next-generation bispecific EGFR ADC, we utilized InduPro\u2019s proprietary MIntTM platform to identify proteins inherently proximal to EGFR on tumor cells. Among multiple proteins in proximity to EGFR, CDCP1 was identified as a TAPA (tumor associated proximity antigen) of interest. Like EGFR, CDCP1 is over-expressed in multiple cancers and plays key roles in oncogenic signaling and malignant transformation (3). Moreover, EGFR signaling induces upregulation and cell surface localization of CDCP1 as well as inhibition of its palmitoylation-dependent degradation (4).Here we report the development of IDP-001, a novel bispecific ADC targeting EGFR and CDCP1. To identify antibodies that display selective activity only on cells that express both EGFR and CDCP1, we generated antibodies to both targets and then combined them to form over 250 hIgG1-based 1+1 bispecific antibodies with diverse epitopes and affinities. This bispecific library was screened on internalization and cytotoxicity assays, yielding a lead candidate that bound domain III of EGFR with a kappa Fab and bound the membrane-distal domain of CDCP1 with an alpaca-derived VHH. We performed further sequence optimization to affinity tune and humanize this antibody, engineer its Fc, and conjugate it with a DAR of 2 via engineered cysteines to a vcMMAE drug linker to yield our final development candidate, IDP-001.IDP-001 incorporates several design principles that distinguish it from other EGFR ADCs, including possible higher tumor exposure and penetration because of its smaller size. Due to its format and conjugation strategy, IDP-001 exhibits excellent biophysical properties and is highly developable. IDP-001 has potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines with varying target expression levels. IDP-001 is a first-in-class bispecific ADC with the potential for a wider therapeutic window and best-in-class efficacy.References1. Dan-yun Ruan et al., JCO 42 (2024) 6013-6013.2.

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) is closely associated with the level of tumor antigen expression and the administered drug dose, as observed in both preclinical and clinical settings. Trop2-targeted ADCs represent a promising therapeutic approach for various solid tumors; however, their efficacy is constrained by the expression levels of Trop2 and the off-tumor, on-target toxicity. To address these limitations, we have developed a bi-specific ADC that targets both Trop2 and B7H4, aiming to increase the overall tumor antigen expression level, and reduce the off-tumor toxicity associated with Trop2 by incorporating a single-arm Trop2 antibody and employing a less toxic Topoi NT3 linker payload in the ADC. Our research has confirmed the co-expression of Trop2 and B7H4 on tumor cells in Triple Negative Breast Cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer, while not on normal mucosal epithelial cells. This co-expression profile supports the use of our bi-specific approach to improve cancer targeting efficiency while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. In vitro studies demonstrate that our bi-specific Trop2/B7H4 ADC (IBI3022) exhibits superior cytotoxicity in HT29 cells overexpressing Trop2 and B7H4 compared to mono-specific ADC benchmarks targeting Trop2 or B7H4. Additionally, IBI3022 shows comparable efficacy to B7H4 ADC in B7H4-positive HCC1569 cells and to Trop2 ADC IBI130 in Trop2-positive BxPC3 and HCC1954 cells. In vivo, IBI3022 demonstrates enhanced tumor suppression compared to mono-specific ADC benchmarks in various tumor models with differing levels of Trop2 and B7H4 expression, including MDA-MB-468, HT29-Trop2-B7H4, HCC1806, JIMT1, and NUGC4. The half-life of IBI3022 in mice is 113 hours, supporting its sustained in vivo efficacy. The developability profile of IBI3022 is favorable, and notably, it is well-tolerated in cynomolgus macaques at doses up to 50 mg/kg. Overall, IBI3022 represents a promising bi-specific ADC for the treatment of gynecologic cancers, offering improved efficacy and safety profiles.Citation Format:Jing Chen, Chenjuan Zhu, Chenchen Zhu, Zhongmin Liu, Min Wu, Weiwei Wu, Junjie Deng, Yi Wang, Xiguang Zhang, Yiming Li.

    "abstract": "CLDN18.2 is a promising target for GI cancer therapy, with various modalities under clinical evaluation. However, these therapies face challenges due to the heterogeneous expression of CLDN18.2, leading to inconsistent efficacy and the need of patient stratification, as observed with Zolbetuximab, AZD0901 and IBI343. Besides, these treatments may induce drug resistance by downregulating CLDN18.2. Recently, CDH17 (Cadherin 17) has emerged as a novel target for biologics, often overexpressed in GI cancers. But in normal tissues, it remains inaccessible as it is hidden within the tight junctions of intestinal epithelial cells, which makes it a favorable target for cancer therapy. More importantly, systematic analysis of expression data reveals high co-expression or complementary expression of CDH17 with CLDN18.2 in GI cancers, with no co-expression in other major organs. This discovery presents an opportunity for a bispecific anti-CDH17/CLDN18.2 therapy, potentially addressing the limitation of targeting CLDN18.2 alone. VBC108 is a bispecific ADC designed to target both CDH17 and CLDN18.2 with TOPO1i payload. The unique design maximizes efficacy while minimizing safety risks. VBC108 distinguishes itself from other CLDN18.2-targeting therapies through the following features. VBC108 targets both CDH17 and CLDN18.2, potentially overcoming tumor heterogeneity and covering over 80% of gastric and 50% of pancreatic cancers without CLDN18.2 IHC selection. It has high affinity to CDH17 and CLDN18.2, enhanced binding avidity, internalization and cytotoxicity. Moreover, it has a strong bystander effect to help further overcome the heterogeneity of tumor antigen expression. In CDH17 single-positive CDX models, which represent clinical scenarios lacking targeted therapies, VBC108 exhibited strong efficacy, whereas AZD0901 did not inhibit tumor growth at all. In CDH17/CLDN18.2 double-positive CDX models, representing clinical scenarios with target expression heterogeneity, VBC108 further showed its superiority. In CLDN18.2 single-positive CDX models, reflecting clinical scenarios with available CLDN18.2-targeted therapies, VBC108 demonstrated comparable efficacy with different payload mechanisms. In the PDX (GC, PADC, CRC) studies, especially in the GC model with low to medium expression of CDH17/CLDN18.2, it achieved a 100% CR. Furthermore, preliminary toxicity studies in Cyno-monkeys showed good tolerability with repeated doses. VBC108 also exhibited excellent developability in a comprehensive developability assessment (DA) test, making it a strong candidate for further CMC development. In summary, VBC108, with its unique design, shows the potential as a first-in-class ADC for GI cancer and supports the advancement to clinical trials.Citation Format:Wei (Vivian) Wang, Lingyu Guan, Man Xu, Qun Yin, Chen Dong, Jing Li.

    "abstract": "The ICAM-1 protein has recently been found to bind the CH3 domain of IgG1-type antibodies and suppress their immune effector activity and internalization against ICAM-1 over-expressing cancer cells. Immune effector suppression involves reduced binding of IgG1 to CD16a Fc-\u03b3-activating receptors on NK cells leading to reduced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), as well as binding of the complement initiating C1q protein leading to reduced complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) via allosteric alteration of the Fc domain. The effect of ICAM-1 on reduced antibody internalization, a requisite for ADC cytotoxicity, due to the physical interaction of the ADC antibody component with cell surface ICAM-1 has shown significant suppression of ADC activity against antigen-positive target cells. To overcome ICAM-1/IgG1 cytotoxic suppression, we identified a consensus motif within the IgG1 CH3 domain when modified leads to ICAM-1 refractory antibodies, thereby restoring maximal immune effector and ADC cytotoxicity of target cells. Here we present the development of an ICAM-1 refractory trastuzumab and its efficacy against HER2 cancer cells over-expressing ICAM-1 in native and ADC format. These data demonstrate the importance of how tumor-produced proteins may negatively impact the cytotoxic effects of tumor-targeting antibodies and offers a novel platform to improve upon the efficacy of antibody-based therapeutics in the presence of immunosuppressive proteins such as ICAM-1.Citation Format:J.

    "abstract": "Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a type I receptor tyrosine kinase critical for the development and normal function of epithelial cells. However, its overexpression or hyperactivity in certain cancers can lead to tumor growth and metastasis. While existing EGFR-targeting therapies can effectively inhibit tumor progression, they often cause significant toxicity due to EGFR expression in normal tissues. To mitigate these side effects, we have developed BB-1705, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that utilizes eribulin as its cytotoxic agent.Eribulin is an FDA-approved treatment for metastatic breast cancer and advanced liposarcoma. BB-1705 employs an affinity-optimized anti-EGFR antibody to selectively deliver eribulin to tumor cells, sparing normal tissues by not effectively blocking the EGFR signaling pathway in those areas. This strategy aims to enhance the therapeutic index of EGFR-targeted treatments while minimizing adverse effects on normal tissues.In vitro studies demonstrated that BB-1705 exhibits potent cytotoxicity against a range of cancer cell lines with medium to high levels of EGFR expression, while showing reduced efficacy against normal human keratinocytes, likely due to their lower EGFR expression and the antibody's affinity profile. Notably, BB-1705 also induced a significant bystander effect on EGFR-low/null cells when co-cultured or co-inoculated with EGFR-high cells.In vivo experiments using xenograft models revealed that a single dose of BB-1705 resulted in substantial antitumor activity. When administered repeatedly via a clinically relevant route and schedule, BB-1705 demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and safety in cynomolgus monkeys with manageable hematological side effects and minimal skin toxicity observed even at the highest tested dose (12 mg/kg, Q3W x 3).In summary, our preclinical findings suggest that BB-1705 has the potential to optimize the efficacy and safety profile of EGFR-targeting therapies for cancers characterized by medium to high EGFR expression levels. A clinical trial evaluating BB-1705 is currently underway, aiming to assess its therapeutic potential in treatment of EGFR-expressing human cancers including TNBC, NSCLC and head and neck cancers.Citation Format:Bing Xia, Lixia Cao, Jianfeng Yang, Cui Feng, Fangdun Jiang, Chen Li, Lixia Gu, Yifan Yang, Jing Tian, Jiasheng Geng, Likun Gong, Tingting Liu, Qiuping Qin, Ziping Wei, Yuhong Zhou.

    "abstract": "Background:EGFR and HER3 are co-overexpressed in a spectrum of tumors, including lung, breast, gastrointestinal, renal cell, ovarian, bladder, and prostate cancers. Importantly, HER3 expression is further enhanced upon inhibition of EGFR, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of both EGFR and HER3 could enhance tumor selectivity and improve therapeutic efficacy in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors resistant tumors. This hypothesis has been supported by the clinical data of BL-B01D1, a bispecific ADC currently in clinical development. Here, we developed a differentiated bispecific ADC with stronger antitumor activity in preclinical studies.Methods:We generated DB-1418, an asymmetric IgG-like bispecific ADC, featuring a Fab arm targeting EGFR with medium affinity and a scFv arm targeting HER3 with high affinity. The antibody is conjugated to a linker-payload L101P1021 at a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 6.Results:The bispecific antibody showed low affinity on EGFR-only or HER3-only cell lines but demonstrated high affinity on tumor cells co-expressing both EGFR and HER3 compared to the parent monospecific antibodies. It also showed higher internalization capacity than the parent monospecific antibodies. DB-1418 exhibited broad anti-tumor activity across different expression levels of EGFR and HER3. Superior tumor inhibition was observed compared to a BL-B01D1 analog, based on both equal molar and mass concentrations. In the EGFR-dominant CAL-27 model, DB-1418 demonstrated a significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 83% at a dose of 1.9 mg/kg Q3W, whereas the BL-B01D1 analog achieved only a 73% TGI at a dose of 3 mg/kg Q3W. In the HER3-dominant SW-620 model, DB-1418 treatment at a dose of 10 mg/kg Q3W resulted in complete tumor regression in 4 out of 5 mice and persisted up to 63 days after administration, whereas the BL-B01D1 analog at the same dose level and frequency failed to inhibit tumor growth. Notably, in an osimertinib-resistant NSCLC xenograft model with the C797S mutation, DB-1418 induced tumor regression with a TGI of 98% at a dose of 6 mg/kg Q3W, significantly higher than the BL-B01D1 analog at 6 mg/kg Q3W (TGI of 68%, p<0.01). DB-1418 demonstrated in vitro plasma stability in human, monkey, and rat models. In cynomolgus monkeys, the dose-range finding study showed favorable safety, with the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) reaching up to 45 mg/kg.Conclusion:DB-1418 has shown promising pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties, differentiated from the current clinical trial bispecific ADC targeting EGFR and HER3, with a broader therapeutic window. DB-1418 offers additional treatment options for patients who have developed resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and addresses other unmet medical needs.Citation Format:Yunhua Zhou, Jun Yao, Rong Shi, Yang Qiu, Haiqing Hua.

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) are frequently co-expressed in multiple solid cancers, and over-activation of MET signaling is one of the major mechanisms of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Antagonistic bispecific antibodies targeting both EGFR and MET have been shown to overcome this resistance. KA-2886-LD38 is a bispecific ADC targeting both EGFR and MET. It is a bispecific common light chain IgG1 , conjugated with LD-38, an Escugen proprietary ADC platform composed of TopIi payload and highly hydrophilic stable cleavable linker. It binds to MET with an affinity of 0.02 nM and to EGFR with an affinity of 1 nM. KA-2886-LD38 blocks the binding of HGF to MET with an IC50 of about 0.3 nM and the interaction of EGF with EGFR with an IC50 of about 2 nM. Compared to the benchmark ADC AZD9592, KA-2886-LD38 exhibits a similar internalization rate when binding to tumor cells but demonstrates significantly stronger cytotoxicity and bystander killing activity across different tumor cell lines in vitro. Additionally, in xenograft mouse tumor models with various tumor types, including NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer, KA-2886-LD38 showed much stronger in vivo efficacy compared to AZD9592. Moreover, KA-2886-LD38, when combined with osimertinib, also demonstrated a combination inhibitory effect on H1975 tumor growth. KA-2886-LD38 is well-tolerated at doses up to 30 mg/kg in EGFR and MET humanized genetically modified mice, and toxicity studies in monkeys are ongoing. These results suggest that KA-2886-LD38 has remarkable potential in the landscape of anti-EGFR/cMet therapies.Citation Format:Guojin Wu, Chuanying Xu, Weihong Nian, Zhengcheng Guo, Jiabei Liang, Feng He, Qing Zhou, Jinying Ning.
